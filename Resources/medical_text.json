The pain usually goes away after the baby is born. But for many women, back\npain lingers for months after giving birth.\nYou can blame your growing uterus  for your aching back. Your expanding uterus shifts\nyour center of gravity and stretches out and weakens your abdominal muscles. This\nchanges your posture and puts a strain on your back. Plus, the extra weight you\u2019re\ncarrying means more work for your muscles and increased stress on your joints. This is\nwhy your back may feel worse at the end of the day.\nThe abdominal muscles support the spine and play an important role in the health of the\nback. During pregnancy, these muscles stretch and weaken. These changes also can\nincrease your risk of hurting your back during exercise.\nYes, pregnancy hormones  can contribute to back pain.

She had preeclampsia\u00a0and a\npreterm birth, and her baby spent 6 weeks in the NICU (neonatal intensive care\nunit).\nFour years later, she was pregnant again. This time, she found herself facing\ndepression during pregnancy, another stressful preterm birth, and postpartum\nPatient Story\n\ue925\n\ndepression.\nLeila, now 38 and living in Texas, shares what she went through and what she\u2019s\nlearned in this edited interview.\nACOG: Describe your first pregnancy and the onset of preeclampsia.\nLeila: Up until 26 weeks, I was having the perfect pregnancy. Then I went in for a\nroutine appointment, and my ob-gyn told me, \u201cYou're spilling protein into your\nurine and your blood pressure's spiking. I'm diagnosing you with preeclampsia.\u201d\nIt was like a bomb had gone off in my head. I was more scared about my\ndaughter than myself. I was thinking, \u201cWhat is happening? What do I do next?\u201d\nACOG: What were the following\nweeks of your pregnancy like?\nLeila: I was keeping a daily diary of\nmy blood pressure readings, in the\nmorning and in the evening. I would\ntalk with my ob-gyn every week \u2013 I\nwould do urine tests and she would\nmonitor me. I also had to do\nnonstress tests\u00a0between 26 and 31\nweeks.\nThen I woke up one day, and I just had a very bad feeling. I went to see my ob-\ngyn, and sure enough \u2013 she told me I needed to be admitted to the hospital. I\nchecked in to the hospital Thursday evening, and a cesarean was planned for\nSaturday morning.\nACOG: At 31 weeks, what was your daughter\u2019s condition?\n\nLeila: She was born at 3 pounds, 4 ounces. Her foot was the size of my thumb. I\nwasn\u2019t allowed to hold her. The hospital where we delivered didn't have a NICU,\nso she was transferred to a hospital that was more than 2 hours away. I couldn\u2019t\nbe with her, and that was hard.\nShe had a machine to help her breathe, and she had trouble learning how to\nsuck. She was in the NICU for 43 days. She was finally sent home with a heart\nmonitor, and by then she was eating.\nACOG: Four years later, you were pregnant again with your son. What was your\nframe of mind at that point?\nLeila: That was so hard. To be honest, I was upset\u00a0\u2013\u00a0I didn't want to be pregnant.\nIronically, everything was perfectly textbook for most of the pregnancy. I wasn't\nsick. I had great energy. But emotionally, I just wasn't feeling it.\nACOG: What did your ob-gyn have to say about your stressful feelings?\nLeila: She said, \u201cI know you're scared\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and this is scary\u00a0\u2013\u00a0but you went through\nit once, and we\u2019re going to get through this.\u201d\nShe also said that maybe I had a little PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder]\nfrom my first birth experience. She said I might need to start talking to someone\nabout this anxiety I was building up, which I knew wasn't good for me or the\nbaby.\nShe did recommend counseling, but at that point I was brushing it off. In those\nearly months, I understood that she was trying to help, but I was not ready for\nthat conversation.\nACOG: Looking back, were there any early signs that you might have been\ndepressed?\n\nLeila: I realize now this was a really bad sign, but between 26 and 31 weeks, I\nstarted writing goodbye letters for my daughter. I kept thinking, \u201cI'm not going to\nget out of this. I'm just going to stay in the hospital. Baby would come home and\nbe fine, sister would be fine, but mommy would definitely not be there.\u201d\n[Depression During Pregnancy]\nACOG: How did your second pregnancy conclude?\nLeila: I kept telling my doctor every time I would visit, \u201cYou know, I'm going to\nhave preeclampsia again. This is going to happen.\u201d And she would say, \u201cNo, your\nlabs look fine, your blood pressure's perfect. You don't have to worry about it.\u201d\nThen one morning when I was 34 and a half weeks, I had the most intense\nmigraine. I didn't think anything of it, but I checked my blood pressure and it was\nextremely high. Then I started throwing up and having blurry vision, a sign of\npreeclampsia. I called my husband and said, \u201cI think it's time!\u201d Because of my\nanxiety, I had already prepacked everything, including baby things, and they were\nalready in the car.\nWe made it to the hospital, and the doctors spoke with me about having a\ncesarean. It happened the next day. My blood pressure had to be lowered a little\nbit before I could have the cesarean.\nACOG: How were you and your son after the delivery?\nLeila: He was born at 5 pounds, 5 ounces and went to the NICU for 11 days. He\ncould have come home in a few days, but he needed some time to learn to eat\nby himself.\nI went back to work after 10 weeks, but I wasn't really engaged. I remember\nduring my hour-long commute to and from work, sometimes I would pull over\nand just sit in my car on the interstate. That didn\u2019t seem off to me at the time. I\nthought, \u201cOh, I just need a moment. Just give me a moment.\u201d If I had gotten hit, I\n\ndon't think I would have cared at that point. Or if I had kept driving past work or\npast my house, it wouldn't have been a big deal to me.\nI just had those moments where I felt, I\u2019ve already said goodbye to my daughter\nin letters, and I didn't even want my son. I wasn't crying or upset. I was just\nnumb.\n[Postpartum Depression]\nACOG: When did you end up getting help for depression?\nLeila: My boss finally called me in to a meeting one day. She told me she had\ngone through postpartum depression and maybe I should look into it.\nThe next time I went back to my doctor, she also noticed a change in me. She\nsaid, \u201cYou had built up this anxiety so much over the course of your pregnancy. I\nthink it's time to go get help.\u201d\nI found a therapist online and chatted with her. She suggested group counseling\nand I found a group that was nearby. I only went once, but it was helpful. The\ngroup counselor said that I should try therapeutic writing, since I like to write.\nShe also made me check in with her every so often. The writing really did help\nme. I journaled anything and everything. If I was feeling overwhelmed, I wrote it\ndown. If I was feeling numb, I wrote it down. If I was busy, I wrote it down.\nI also learned about an online support group, Postpartum Support International.\nYou can text their help line whenever you need to.\nACOG: Your kids are now 7 and 4. What do you think about all of this now,\nlooking back?\nLeila: Sometimes I still wonder why I had preeclampsia. I didn\u2019t smoke, I didn't\ndrink, I worked out, I walked, I ate healthy meals. But I also think about moms\nwho aren\u2019t able to have a baby at all. So in the end, I'm grateful for the way my\n\nAbout ACOG\nDisclaimer\nContact Us\nHow to Find an Ob-Gyn\nstory played out. I\u2019ve come to realize that we all have different birth experiences,\nand not everyone's going to have the same story.\nACOG: What do you wish other women knew about postpartum depression?\nLeila: Statistically, 1 in 7 women get postpartum depression, and everyone\nknows more than seven women. We should always strive to reach out to moms.\nI know it's lovely to just think, \u201cOh, I want to hold the baby,\u201d but try to at least get\nin there and see about the mom. Really ask how she is doing.\nPostpartum depression is most often temporary and treatable. Almost all\nwomen who seek treatment recover fully.

It is more than feeling\nsad or upset for a short time or feeling grief after a loss. Depression changes your\nthoughts, feelings, behavior, and physical health. It affects how you function in your daily\nlife. It can also affect how you relate to your family, friends, and coworkers. Depression\ncan occur at different times of life or in different situations.\nDepression is common during pregnancy, affecting about 1 in 10 pregnant women.\nSome women have depression and anxiety for the first time in their lives during\npregnancy or after delivery. (Read Postpartum Depression to learn about depression\nafter pregnancy.)\nThe signs of depression can seem like the normal ups and downs of pregnancy. A blue\nmood now and then is normal. But it\u2019s important to know the signs of depression. Talk\nwith your obstetrician\u2013gynecologist (ob-gyn)  if you have any of these signs for at least\n2 weeks:\nFAQs\nWhat is depression?\nHow common is depression during pregnancy?\nWhat are the signs of depression during pregnancy?\nDepressed mood most of the day, nearly every day\n\u2022\nLoss of interest in work or other activities\n\u2022\nFeeling guilty, hopeless, or worthless\n\u2022\n\nThinking about death or suicide is a sign of depression. If you are in crisis or feel like\nyou want to harm yourself or others, call 988 right away. 988 is the Suicide & Crisis\nLifeline, which offers free support and resources. Read the Resources section for other\nsupport options, including more helplines you can text or call and online pregnancy\nsupport groups. You can also talk with a trusted friend, family member, or your ob-gyn.\nWomen who have severe depression during pregnancy may have trouble taking care of\nthemselves. They may not eat healthfully, attend prenatal care checkups, or get enough\nrest. If you took antidepressants before pregnancy, you may become depressed again if\nyou stop taking them. Having untreated depression during pregnancy also raises your\nrisk of postpartum depression . Read\u00a0Postpartum Depression to learn more.\nDepression during pregnancy has been linked to several problems, including:\nAlso, when depression isn\u2019t treated during pregnancy, it can increase the risk of\nproblems for your child:\nSleeping more than normal or having trouble sleeping\n\u2022\nLoss of appetite, losing weight, or eating much more than normal and gaining weight\n\u2022\nFeeling very tired or without energy\n\u2022\nHaving trouble paying attention, concentrating, or making decisions\n\u2022\nBeing restless or slowed down in a way that others notice\n\u2022\nThinking about death or suicide (see below)\n\u2022\nWhat should I do if I am thinking about death or suicide?\nHow can untreated depression affect me during pregnancy?\nHow can untreated depression affect my fetus and newborn?\nThe fetus  not growing well in the uterus\n\u2022\nGoing into labor too early\n\u2022\nThe baby being too small at birth\n\u2022\nHealth complications  for the baby after birth\n\u2022\nYour newborn may cry more and be harder to comfort.\n\nTalk with your ob-gyn as soon as possible. Tell them if you had depression in the past, if\nyou take medication for depression, or if you are feeling depressed now. Also read the\nResources section for more support options.\nYour ob-gyn may ask questions about your mood during prenatal care  or postpartum\nvisits. Or they may ask you to write down answers to a survey that screens for mental\nhealth conditions. Your answers will help your ob-gyn understand what kind of help you\nneed.\nTreatment of depression may include psychotherapy  (talk therapy), medication called\nantidepressants , or a combination of both. Support from your partner, family members,\nand friends can also be helpful. Your loved ones may be able to see if your depression is\ngetting worse before you notice it yourself.\nMany people also find that self-care (including sleep, healthful eating, and light exercise)\nand social support groups can be helpful in recovering from depression. Postpartum\nSupport International offers online support group meetings and referrals to mental\nhealth professionals who offer care during and after pregnancy.

For example, some types of therapy\nhelp you change how you think and behave, while other types of therapy help you better\nunderstand underlying issues. You may have one-on-one therapy (with just you and the\ntherapist) or group therapy where you meet with a therapist and other people with\nproblems similar to yours. Another option is family or couples therapy, in which you and\nfamily members or your partner may work with a therapist.\nAntidepressants are medications that work to balance the chemicals in the brain that\naffect your moods. There are many types of antidepressants. If one type does not work\nfor you, your ob-gyn can prescribe another. It often takes at least 3 to 4 weeks of taking\nthe medication before you start to feel better.\nUntreated depression can be harmful to you, your fetus, and your baby after birth. The\nrisks of untreated depression need to be weighed against the risks of the medication.\nStudies suggest that most selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)  do not\nincrease the risk of birth defects. But researchers are still learning whether other\nantidepressants can cause certain birth defects . You and your ob-gyn can discuss\nwhich medication is best for you and your fetus.\nAnxiety is common during pregnancy. Pregnancy also can trigger obsessive-compulsive\ndisorder (OCD). Anxiety and OCD can occur alone or with other mental health\nconditions, including depression.\n[What I Tell My Pregnant and Postpartum Patients About Depression and Anxiety]\nIf you have anxiety and stress, tell your ob-gyn. Also tell them about any stressful life\nevents. These may include losing a loved one, having a loved one who is ill, living far\nfrom your friends and family, or moving. Not having support and resources for your\npregnancy can also be a major source of stress.

Physical activity does not increase your risk of miscarriage, low birth\nweight, or early delivery.\nIt\u2019s still important to discuss exercise with your obstetrician\u2013gynecologist (ob-gyn)\nduring your early prenatal visits. If your ob-gyn gives you the OK to exercise, you can\ndiscuss what activities you can do safely.\nRegular exercise during pregnancy benefits you and your fetus in these key ways:\nFAQs\nIs it safe to exercise during pregnancy?\nWhat are the benefits of exercise during pregnancy?\nReduces back pain\n\u2022\nEases constipation\n\u2022\nMay decrease your risk of gestational diabetes , preeclampsia, and cesarean birth\n\u2022\nPromotes healthy weight gain during pregnancy\n\u2022\nImproves your overall fitness and strengthens your heart and blood vessels\n\u2022\nHelps you to lose the baby weight after your baby is born\n\u2022\n\nGuidelines for Exercise\nIdeally, pregnant women should get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic\nactivity every week. An aerobic activity is one in which you move large muscles of the\nbody (like those in the legs and arms) in a rhythmic way. Moderate intensity means you\nare moving enough to raise your heart rate and start sweating. You still can talk\nnormally, but you cannot sing.\nExamples of moderate-intensity aerobic activity include brisk walking and general\ngardening (raking, weeding, or digging). You can divide the 150 minutes into 30-minute\nworkouts on 5 days of the week or into smaller 10-minute workouts throughout each\nday.\nIf you are new to exercise, start out slowly and gradually increase your activity. Begin\nwith as little as 5 minutes a day. Add 5 minutes each week until you can stay active for\n30 minutes a day.\nIf you were very active before pregnancy, you can keep doing the same workouts with\nyour\u00a0ob-gyn\u2019s approval.\u00a0But if you start to lose weight, you may need to increase the\nnumber of calories that you eat.\nYour body goes through many changes during pregnancy. It is important to choose\nexercises that take these changes into account:\nHow much should I exercise during pregnancy?\nWhat changes occur in the body during pregnancy that can affect my exercise\nroutine?\nJoints\u2014The hormones  made during pregnancy cause the ligaments that support\nyour joints to become relaxed. This makes the joints more mobile and at risk of\ninjury. Avoid jerky, bouncy, or high-impact motions that can increase your risk of\nbeing hurt.\n\u2022\nBalance\u2014The extra weight in the front of your body shifts your center of gravity. This\nplaces stress on joints and muscles, especially those in your pelvis and lower back.\nBecause you are less stable and more likely to lose your balance, you are at greater\nrisk of falling.\n\u2022\n\nExercising Safely\nExperts agree these exercises are safest for pregnant women:\nBreathing\u2014When you exercise, oxygen  and blood flow are directed to your muscles\nand away from other areas of your body. While you are pregnant, your need for\noxygen increases. This may affect your ability to do strenuous exercise, especially if\nyou are overweight or obese.\n\u2022\nWhat precautions should I take when exercising during pregnancy?\nDrink plenty of water before, during, and after your workout. Signs of dehydration\ninclude dizziness, a racing or pounding heart, and urinating only small amounts or\nhaving urine that is dark yellow.\n\u2022\nWear a sports bra that gives lots of support to help protect your breasts. Later in\npregnancy, a belly support belt may reduce discomfort while walking or running.\n\u2022\nAvoid becoming overheated, especially in the first trimester. Drink plenty of water,\nwear loose-fitting clothing, and exercise in a temperature-controlled room. Do not\nexercise outside when it is very hot or humid.\n\u2022\nAvoid standing still or lying flat on your back as much as possible. When you lie on\nyour back, your uterus  presses on a large vein that returns blood to the heart.\nStanding motionless can cause blood to pool in your legs and feet. These positions\nmay cause your blood pressure to decrease for a short time.\n\u2022\nWhat are some safe exercises I can do during pregnancy?\nWalking\u2014Brisk walking gives a total body workout and is easy on the joints and\nmuscles.\n\u2022\nSwimming and water workouts\u2014Water workouts use many of the body\u2019s muscles.\nThe water supports your weight so you avoid injury and muscle strain.\n\u2022\nStationary bicycling\u2014Because your growing belly can affect your balance and make\nyou more prone to falls, riding a standard bicycle during pregnancy can be risky.\nCycling on a stationary bike is a better choice.\n\u2022\n\nIf you are an experienced runner, jogger, or racquet-sports player, you may be able to\nkeep doing these activities during pregnancy. Discuss these activities with your ob-gyn.\nWhile pregnant, avoid activities that put you at increased risk of injury, such as the\nfollowing:\nWhether you\u2019re a seasoned athlete or a beginner, watch for the following warning signs\nwhen you exercise. If you have any of them, stop and call your ob-gyn.\nModified yoga and modified Pilates\u2014Yoga reduces stress, improves flexibility, and\nencourages stretching and focused breathing. There are prenatal yoga and Pilates\nclasses designed for pregnant women. These classes often teach modified poses\nthat accommodate a pregnant woman\u2019s shifting balance. You should avoid poses\nthat require you to be still or lie on your back for long periods.\n\u2022\nWhat exercises should I avoid during pregnancy?\nContact sports and sports that put you at risk of getting hit in the abdomen, including\nice hockey, boxing, soccer, and basketball\n\u2022\nSkydiving\n\u2022\nActivities that may result in a fall, such as downhill snow skiing, water skiing, surfing,\noff-road cycling, gymnastics, and horseback riding\n\u2022\n\"Hot yoga\u201d or \u201chot Pilates,\u201d which may cause you to become overheated\n\u2022\nScuba diving\n\u2022\nActivities performed above 6,000 feet (if you do not already live at a high altitude)\n\u2022\nWhat are warning signs that I should stop exercising?\nBleeding from the vagina\n\u2022\nFeeling dizzy or faint\n\u2022\nShortness of breath before starting exercise\n\u2022\nChest pain\n\u2022\nHeadache\n\u2022\nMuscle weakness\n\u2022\nCalf pain or swelling\n\u2022\n\nOther Questions\nExercising after your baby is born may help improve mood and decreases the risk of\ndeep vein thrombosis (DVT) , a condition that can occur more frequently in women in\nthe weeks after childbirth.

They are a type of birth defect. Some genetic disorders may not be noticed until\nthe child is older.\nGenetic counseling and screening tests  can help assess your risk of having a baby with\ncertain genetic disorders. Diagnostic tests  can detect if a specific genetic disorder is\npresent in the fetus .\nA gene is a small piece of hereditary material called DNA . Each gene controls some\naspect of how your body looks or functions. Genes come in pairs.\nChromosomes are the structures inside cells  that carry genes. Chromosomes also\ncome in pairs. Most cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes for a total of 46\nchromosomes. Sperm  and egg  cells each have 23 chromosomes.\nDuring fertilization , when the egg and sperm join, the two sets of chromosomes come\ntogether. In this way, one half of a baby\u2019s genes come from the baby\u2019s mother and one\nFAQs\nWhat are genetic disorders?\nWhat are genes?\nWhat are chromosomes?\n\nhalf come from the baby\u2019s father.\nYour baby\u2019s sex is determined by sex chromosomes. There are two sex chromosomes:\nX and Y. Egg cells only contain an X chromosome. Sperm cells can carry an X or a Y. A\ncombination of XX results in a girl and XY results in a boy.\nTypes of Genetic Disorders\nChromosome disorders involve having missing or extra chromosomes. This is called\naneuploidy . Most children with chromosome disorders have physical defects. Some\nhave intellectual disabilities.\nTrisomy  is the most common aneuploidy. In trisomy, there is an extra chromosome. A\ncommon trisomy is Down syndrome (trisomy 21) . Other trisomies include Patau\nsyndrome (trisomy 13)  and Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18) .\nMonosomy  is another type of aneuploidy in which there is a missing chromosome. A\ncommon monosomy is Turner syndrome , in which a female has a missing or damaged\nX chromosome.\nThe risk of having a child with chromosome disorder increases as you age.\nAn inherited disorder is caused by a faulty gene that can be passed from parent to child.\nFaulty genes can occur on any of the chromosomes. There are autosomal dominant\ndisorders , autosomal recessive disorders , and sex-linked disorders .\nAn autosomal dominant disorder is caused by just one faulty gene from either parent.\n\u201cAutosomal\u201d means that the defective gene is located on any of the chromosomes that\nare not the sex chromosomes (X or Y).\nIf one parent has the gene, each child of the couple has a 50 percent chance of\ninheriting the disorder. An example of an autosomal dominant disorder is Huntington\nWhat are chromosome disorders?\nWhat are inherited disorders?\nWhat is an autosomal dominant disorder?\n\ndisease .\nAutosomal recessive disorders only happen when both parents carry the gene. An\nexample of an autosomal recessive disorder is cystic fibrosis (CF) .\nA carrier  of a recessive disorder is a person who carries one copy of a gene that works\nincorrectly and one that works normally. A carrier may not have symptoms of the\ndisorder or may have only mild symptoms.\nIf both parents are carriers of an abnormal gene, there is a 25 percent chance that the\nchild will get the abnormal gene from each parent and will have the disorder. There is a\n50 percent chance that the child will be a carrier of the disorder\u2014just like the carrier\nparents. If only one parent is a carrier, there is a 50 percent chance that the child will be\na carrier.\nSex-linked disorders are caused by defective genes on the sex chromosomes. An\nexample of a sex-linked disorder is hemophilia . This disease is caused by a faulty gene\non the X chromosome.\nMultifactorial disorders are caused by a combination of factors. Some factors are\ngenetic and some are not. A few of these disorders can be detected during pregnancy.\nSometimes they can be corrected with surgery.\nRisk Factors and Testing\nMost babies with genetic disorders are born to couples without risk factors. But the risk\nof genetic disorders is higher when certain factors are present. This is why screening\nWhat is an autosomal recessive disorder?\nWhat does it mean to be a carrier of a recessive disorder?\nWhat are sex-linked disorders?\nWhat are multifactorial disorders?\nWho is at risk of having a baby with a genetic disorder?\n\nbegins by assessing your risk factors before or during pregnancy. You are at increased\nrisk if\nSome genetic disorders are more common in certain ethnic groups.\nA genetic counselor  has special training in genetics. A genetic counselor will study your\nfamily health history and may recommend you have physical exams or tests with your\nobstetrician\u2013gynecologist (ob-gyn) . Using the test results, the counselor will assess\nyour baby\u2019s risk of having a problem, discuss your options, and talk about any concerns\nyou may have.\nScreening tests assess the risk that a baby may be born with a specific genetic disorder.\nDiagnostic tests can detect if a specific genetic disorder is present in the fetus.\n[ACOG Explains: Prenatal Genetic Testing]\nCarrier screening is a type of screening test that can show if a person carries a gene for\nan inherited disorder. Carrier screening can be done before or during pregnancy. Read\nCarrier Screening\u00a0to learn more.\nAnyone who is thinking about pregnancy or already pregnant can have carrier screening.\nYour partner may be tested too.\nCarrier screening can test for many disorders, including cystic fibrosis (CF), spinal\nmuscular atrophy (SMA) , and hemoglobinopathies .

Other screening tests that can\nbe done during pregnancy include the following:\nRead Prenatal Genetic Screening Tests to learn more about these tests.\nThere are no risks to the fetus with any of these screening tests.\nDiagnostic tests may be recommended if a screening test shows an increased risk of a\nbirth defect. Diagnostic tests should also be offered as a first choice to everyone during\npregnancy, even if you do not have risk factors. Diagnostic tests can detect if a specific\nbirth defect or genetic disorder is present.\nDiagnostic tests are done on cells from the fetus obtained through amniocentesis ,\nchorionic villus sampling (CVS) , or rarely, fetal blood sampling. The chromosomes and\ngenes in the cells are analyzed using different techniques to diagnose certain inherited\ndefects and many chromosomal defects. Read Prenatal Genetic Diagnostic Tests to\nlearn more.\nWhat screening tests are offered during pregnancy?\nBlood tests that measure the level of certain substances in your blood combined with\nan ultrasound exam . These tests assess the risk that a baby will have Down\nsyndrome, other trisomies, or neural tube defects (NTDs) .\n\u2022\nCell-free DNA  screening (also called noninvasive prenatal testing or NIPT). Cell-free\nDNA is the small amount of DNA that is released from the placenta  into your\nbloodstream. The cell-free DNA in a sample of your blood can be screened for Down\nsyndrome, other trisomies, and problems with the number of sex chromosomes.\n\u2022\nAre there risks to the fetus with screening tests?\nWhen are diagnostic tests offered during pregnancy?\nHow are diagnostic tests done?\nAre there risks to the pregnancy with diagnostic tests?\n\nYes, diagnostic tests carry a very small risk of pregnancy loss.\nYour ob-gyn or a genetic counselor can discuss all of the testing options with you and\nhelp you decide.\nWhether you want to be tested is a personal choice. Some people would rather not know\nif they are at risk or whether their child will have a disorder. Others want to know in\nadvance. Knowing beforehand gives you time to prepare for having a child with a\ndisorder and to organize the medical care that your child may need. Some parents may\ndecide to end the pregnancy in certain situations.\n[3 Questions to Ask Yourself Before Getting Prenatal Genetic Testing]\nAmniocentesis: A procedure in which amniotic fluid and cells are taken from the uterus\nfor testing.

When eaten, Listeria causes a foodborne illness called listeriosis .\nListeriosis is one of the most serious types of food poisoning.\nListeriosis can cause mild, flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills, muscle aches, and\ndiarrhea or upset stomach. You also may have a stiff neck, headache, confusion, or loss\nof balance. Symptoms may appear as late as 2 months after you have eaten something\nwith Listeria. Many pregnant women do not have any symptoms. Even if you do not feel\nsick, you can pass the infection to your fetus .\nPregnant women are 10 times more likely to get listeriosis than the general population.\nVomiting and diarrhea can cause the body to lose too much water.

Good nutrition helps\nyou handle the extra demands on your body as your pregnancy progresses. The goal is\nto balance getting enough nutrients to support the growth of your fetus  and\nmaintaining a healthy weight.\nThe popular saying is that you should \u201ceat for two\u201d when you're pregnant, but now we\nknow that it\u2019s dangerous to eat twice your usual amount of food during pregnancy.\nInstead of \u201ceating for two,\u201d think of it as eating twice as healthy.\nIf you are pregnant with one fetus, you need an extra 340 calories  per day starting in\nthe second trimester (and a bit more in the third trimester). That's roughly the calorie\ncount of a glass of skim milk and half a sandwich.\nIf you are carrying twins, you should get about 600 extra calories a day. If you are\ncarrying triplets, you should take in 900 extra calories a day.\nKey Vitamins and Minerals\nFAQs\nWhy is nutrition during pregnancy important?\nHow much should I eat during pregnancy?\n\nVitamins and minerals play important roles in all of your body functions. Eating healthy\nfoods and taking a prenatal vitamin every day should supply all the vitamins and\nminerals you need during pregnancy.\nTake only one serving of your prenatal supplement each day. Read the bottle to see how\nmany pills make up one daily serving. If your obstetrician\u2013gynecologist (ob-gyn)  thinks\nyou need an extra amount of a vitamin or mineral, your ob-gyn may recommend it as a\nseparate supplement.\nNo, do not take more than the recommended amount of your prenatal vitamin per day.\nSome multivitamin ingredients, such as vitamin A, can cause birth defects  at higher\ndoses.\nDuring pregnancy you need folic acid , iron, calcium, vitamin D, choline, omega-3 fatty\nacids, B vitamins, and vitamin C. See the below table for recommended amounts.\nKey Vitamins and Minerals During Pregnancy\nNutrient (Daily\nRecommended Amount)\nWhy You and Your\nFetus Need It\nBest Sources\nCalcium (1,300\nmilligrams for ages 14 to\n18; 1,000 milligrams for\nages 19 to 50)\nBuilds strong bones\nand teeth\nMilk, cheese, yogurt, sardines, dark\ngreen leafy vegetables\nIron (27 milligrams)\nHelps red blood cells\ndeliver oxygen  to your\nfetus\nLean red meat, poultry, fish, dried\nbeans and peas, iron-fortified\ncereals, prune juice\nIodine (220 micrograms) Essential for healthy\nbrain development\nIodized table salt, dairy products,\nseafood, meat, some breads, eggs\nWhy should I take a prenatal vitamin?\nHow many prenatal vitamins should I take each day?\nCan I take more prenatal vitamins to make up for a deficiency?\nWhat vitamins and minerals do I need during pregnancy?\n\nNutrient (Daily\nRecommended Amount)\nWhy You and Your\nFetus Need It\nBest Sources\nCholine (450 milligrams) Important for\ndevelopment of your\nfetus\u2019s brain and spinal\ncord\nMilk, beef liver, eggs, peanuts, soy\nproducts\nVitamin A (750\nmicrograms for ages 14\nto 18; 770 micrograms\nfor ages 19 to 50)\nForms healthy skin and\neyesight\nHelps with bone\ngrowth\nCarrots, green leafy vegetables,\nsweet potatoes\nVitamin C (80 milligrams\nfor ages 14 to 18; 85\nmilligrams for ages 19 to\n50)\nPromotes healthy\ngums, teeth, and bones\nCitrus fruit, broccoli, tomatoes,\nstrawberries\nVitamin D (600\ninternational units)\nBuilds your fetus\u2019s\nbones and teeth\nHelps promote healthy\neyesight and skin\nSunlight, fortified milk, fatty fish such\nas salmon and sardines\nVitamin B6 (1.9\nmilligrams)\nHelps form red blood\ncells\nHelps body use\nprotein, fat, and\ncarbohydrates\nBeef, liver, pork, ham, whole-grain\ncereals, bananas\nVitamin B12 (2.6\nmicrograms)\nMaintains nervous\nsystem\nMeat, fish, poultry, milk (vegetarians\nshould take a supplement)\n\nNutrient (Daily\nRecommended Amount)\nWhy You and Your\nFetus Need It\nBest Sources\nHelps form red blood\ncells\nFolic acid (600\nmicrograms)\nHelps prevent birth\ndefects of the brain\nand spine\nSupports the general\ngrowth and\ndevelopment of the\nfetus and placenta\nFortified cereal, enriched bread and\npasta, peanuts, dark green leafy\nvegetables, orange juice, beans.\nAlso, take a daily prenatal vitamin\nwith 400 micrograms of folic acid.\nFolic acid, also known as folate, is a B vitamin that is important during pregnancy. Folic\nacid may help prevent major birth defects of the fetus\u2019s brain and spine called neural\ntube defects (NTDs) .\nWhen you are pregnant you need 600 micrograms of folic acid each day. Because it\u2019s\nhard to get this much folic acid from food alone, you should take a daily prenatal vitamin\nwith at least 400 micrograms starting at least 1 month before pregnancy and during the\nfirst 12 weeks of pregnancy.\nIf you have already had a child with an NTD, you should take 4 milligrams (mg) of folic\nacid each day as a separate supplement at least 3 months before pregnancy and for the\nfirst 3 months of pregnancy. You and your ob-gyn can discuss whether you need to\nsupplement with more than 400 micrograms daily.\nIron is used by your body to make the extra blood that you and your fetus need during\npregnancy. When you are not pregnant, you need 18 mg of iron per day. When you are\npregnant, you need 27 mg per day. You can get this amount in most prenatal vitamins.\nWhat is folic acid?\nHow much folic acid should I take?\nWhy is iron important during pregnancy?\n\nIn addition to taking a prenatal vitamin with iron, you should eat iron-rich foods such as\nbeans, lentils, enriched breakfast cereals, beef, turkey, liver, and shrimp. You should also\neat foods that help your body absorb iron, including oranges, grapefruit, strawberries,\nbroccoli, and peppers.\nYour blood should be tested during pregnancy to check for anemia . If you have anemia,\nyour ob-gyn may recommend extra iron supplements.\nCalcium is a mineral that builds your fetus\u2019s bones and teeth. If you are 18 or younger,\nyou need 1,300 mg of calcium per day. If you are 19 or older, you need 1,000 mg per day.\nMilk and other dairy products, such as cheese and yogurt, are the best sources of\ncalcium. If you have trouble digesting milk products, you can get calcium from other\nsources, such as broccoli, fortified foods (cereals, breads, and juices), almonds and\nsesame seeds, sardines or anchovies with the bones, and dark green leafy vegetables.\nYou can also get calcium from calcium supplements.\nVitamin D works with calcium to help the fetus\u2019s bones and teeth develop. Vitamin D is\nalso essential for healthy skin and eyesight. Whether you are pregnant or not, you need\n600 international units of vitamin D a day.\nGood sources of vitamin D include fortified milk and breakfast cereal, fatty fish (salmon\nand mackerel), fish liver oils, and egg yolks.\nMany people do not get enough vitamin D. If your ob-gyn\u00a0thinks you may have low levels\nof vitamin D, a test can be done to check the level in your blood. If it is below normal,\nyou may need to take a vitamin D supplement.\nHow can I make sure I\u2019m getting enough iron?\nWhat is calcium and what foods contain it?\nWhat is vitamin D and what foods contain it?\nHow will I know if I\u2019m getting enough vitamin D?\nWhat is choline and what foods contain it?\n\nCholine plays a role in your fetus\u2019s brain development. It may also help prevent some\ncommon birth defects. Experts recommend that you get 450 mg of choline each day\nduring pregnancy.\nCholine can be found in chicken, beef, eggs, milk, soy products, and peanuts. Although\nthe body produces some choline on its own, it doesn\u2019t make enough to meet all your\nneeds while you are pregnant. It\u2019s important to get choline from your diet because it is\nnot found in most prenatal vitamins.\nOmega-3 fatty acids are a type of fat found naturally in many kinds of fish. Omega-3s\nmay be important for brain development before and after birth.\nFlaxseed (ground or as oil) is also a good source of omega-3s. Other sources of omega-\n3s include broccoli, cantaloupe, kidney beans, spinach, cauliflower, and walnuts.\nEat two or three servings of fish or shellfish per week before getting pregnant, while\npregnant, and while breastfeeding. A serving of fish is 4 ounces (oz).\nSome types of fish have higher levels of mercury than others. Mercury is a metal that\nhas been linked to birth defects. Do not eat bigeye tuna, king mackerel, marlin, orange\nroughy, shark, swordfish, or tilefish. Limit white (albacore) tuna to only 6 oz a week.\u00a0Also\ncheck advisories about fish caught in local waters.\nB vitamins, including B1, B2, B6, B9, and B12, are key nutrients during pregnancy. These\nvitamins\nWhat are omega-3 fatty acids and what foods contain omega-3s?\nHow much fish should I eat to get the omega-3 fatty acids that I need?\nWhich types of fish should I avoid?\nWhat are B vitamins and what foods contain them?\ngive you energy\n\u2022\nsupply energy for your fetus\u2019s development\n\u2022\npromote good vision\n\u2022\nhelp build the placenta\n\u2022\n\nYour prenatal vitamin should have the right amount of B vitamins that you need each\nday. Eating foods high in B vitamins is a good idea too, including liver, pork, chicken,\nbananas, beans, and whole-grain cereals and breads.\nVitamin C is important for a healthy immune system. It also helps build strong bones\nand muscles. During pregnancy, you should get at least 85 mg of vitamin C each day if\nyou are older than 19, and 80 mg if you are younger than 19.\nYou can get the right amount of vitamin C in your daily prenatal vitamin, and also from\ncitrus fruits and juices, strawberries, broccoli, and tomatoes.\nDrink throughout the day, not just when you are thirsty. Aim for 8 to 12 cups of water a\nday during pregnancy.\nPlanning Healthy Meals\nThere are many tools that can help you plan healthy meals. One useful tool is the\nMyPlate food-planning guide from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The MyPlate\nwebsite, www.myplate.gov, can help you learn how to make healthy food choices at\nevery meal.\nThe MyPlate website offers a MyPlate Plan, which shows how much to eat based on\nhow many calories you need each day. The MyPlate Plan is personalized based on your\nWhat is vitamin C and what foods contain it?\nHow can I get enough water during pregnancy?\nHow can I plan healthy meals during pregnancy?\nheight\n\u2022\nprepregnancy weight\n\u2022\nphysical activity level\n\u2022\n\nThe MyPlate Plan can help you learn about choosing foods from each food group to get\nthe vitamins and minerals you need during pregnancy. The MyPlate Plan can also help\nyou limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats.\nBread, pasta, oatmeal, cereal, and tortillas are all grains. Whole grains are those that\nhaven\u2019t been processed and include the whole grain kernel. Oats, barley, quinoa, brown\nrice, and bulgur are all whole grains, as are products made with those grains. Look for\nthe words \u201cwhole grain\u201d on the product label. When you plan meals, make half of your\ngrain servings whole grains.\nYou can eat fresh, canned, frozen, or dried fruit. Juice that is 100 percent fruit juice\ncounts in the fruit category, but it is best to eat mostly whole fruit instead of juice. Make\nhalf your plate fruit and vegetables during mealtimes.\nYou can eat raw, canned, frozen, or dried vegetables or drink 100 percent vegetable\njuice. Use dark leafy greens to make salads. Make half your plate fruit and vegetables\nduring mealtimes.\nMeat, poultry, seafood, beans, peas, eggs, processed soy products, nuts, and seeds all\ncontain protein. Eat a variety of protein each day.\nWhat are the five food groups?\nGrains\n\u2022\nFruits\n\u2022\nVegetables\n\u2022\nProtein foods\n\u2022\nDairy foods\n\u2022\nWhat are grains?\nWhat types of fruit should I eat?\nWhat types of vegetables should I eat?\nWhat are protein foods?\n\nMilk and milk products, such as cheese and yogurt, make up the dairy group. Make sure\nany dairy foods you eat are pasteurized. Choose fat-free or low-fat (1 percent) varieties.\nOils and fats are another part of healthy eating. Although they are not a food group, they\ndo give you important nutrients. During pregnancy, the fats that you eat provide energy\nand help build the placenta and many fetal organs.\nOils in food come mainly from plant sources, such as olive oil, nut oils, and grapeseed\noil. They can also be found in certain foods, such as some fish, avocados, nuts, and\nolives.\nMost of the fats and oils in your diet should come from plant sources. Limit solid fats,\nsuch as those from animal sources. Solid fats can also be found in processed foods.\nWeight Gain\nWeight gain depends on your health and your body mass index (BMI)  before you were\npregnant. If you were underweight before pregnancy, you should gain more weight than\nthose who had a normal weight before pregnancy. If you were overweight or obese\nbefore pregnancy, you should gain less weight. The amount of weight gain differs by\ntrimester :\nSee the below table for recommended weight gain during pregnancy.\nWeight Gain During Pregnancy\nWhat are dairy foods?\nWhy are oils and fats important?\nWhat are healthy sources of oils and fats?\nHow much weight should I gain during pregnancy?\nDuring your first 12 weeks of pregnancy\u2014the first trimester\u2014you might gain only 1 to\n5 pounds or none at all.\n\u2022\nIf you were a healthy weight before pregnancy, you should gain a half-pound to 1\npound per week in your second and third trimesters.\n\u2022\n\nBody Mass Index\n(BMI) Before\nPregnancy\nRate of Weight Gain\nin the Second and\nThird Trimesters*\n(Pounds Per Week)\nRecommended Total\nWeight Gain With a\nSingle Fetus (in\nPounds)\nRecommended Total\nWeight Gain With\nTwins (in Pounds)\nLess than 18.5\n(underweight)\n1.0 to 1.3\n28 to 40\nNot known\n18.5 to 24.9\n(normal weight)\n0.8 to 1.0\n25 to 35\n37 to 54\n25.0 to 29.9\n(overweight)\n0.5 to 0.7\n15 to 25\n31 to 50\n30.0 and above\n(obese)\n0.4 to 0.6\n11 to 20\n25 to 42\n*Assumes a first-trimester weight gain between 1.1 and 4.4 pounds\nSource: Institute of Medicine and National Research Council. 2009. Weight Gain During\nPregnancy: Reexamining the Guidelines. Washington, DC: The National Academies\nPress.\nDuring the first trimester with one fetus, usually no extra calories are needed. In the\nsecond trimester, you will need an extra 340 calories per day, and in the third trimester,\nabout 450 extra calories a day. To get the extra calories during the day, have healthy\nsnacks on hand, such as nuts, yogurt, and fresh fruit.\nExcess weight during pregnancy is associated with several pregnancy and childbirth\ncomplications , including\nObesity during pregnancy also increases the risk of:\nHow many extra calories should I eat?\nHow can being overweight cause problems during pregnancy?\nhigh blood pressure\n\u2022\npreeclampsia\n\u2022\npreterm  birth\n\u2022\ngestational diabetes\n\u2022\na larger than normal fetus ( macrosomia )\n\u2022\n\nYou and your ob-gyn should work together to develop a nutrition and exercise plan.

Obesity\nis defined as having a BMI of 30 or greater. Within the general category of obesity, there\nare three levels that reflect the increasing health risks that go along with increasing BMI:\nYou can find out your BMI by using an online BMI calculator.\nObesity during pregnancy puts you at risk of several serious health problems:\nFAQs\nWhat is obesity?\nObesity category I\u2014BMI of 30 to 34.9\n\u2022\nObesity category II\u2014BMI of 35 to 39.9\n\u2022\nObesity category III\u2014BMI of 40 or greater\n\u2022\nDoes obesity put me at risk of any health problems during pregnancy?\nGestational hypertension \u2014 High blood pressure  that starts during the second half\nof pregnancy is called gestational hypertension. It can lead to serious\ncomplications .\n\u2022\nPreeclampsia \u2014Preeclampsia is a serious form of gestational hypertension that\nusually happens in the second half of pregnancy or soon after childbirth. This\ncondition can cause your kidneys  and liver to fail. In rare cases, seizures, heart\n\u2022\n\n[What\u2019s the Concern About High Blood Pressure During Pregnancy? An Ob-Gyn\nExplains.]\nObesity increases the risk of the following problems during pregnancy:\nPreparing for Pregnancy\nattack, and stroke  can happen. Other risks include problems with the placenta  and\ngrowth problems for the fetus .\nGestational diabetes \u2014High levels of glucose  (blood sugar) during pregnancy\nincrease the risk of having a very large baby. This also increases the chance of\ncesarean birth . If you have had gestational diabetes, you and your children may have\na higher risk of diabetes mellitus  in the future.\n\u2022\nObstructive sleep apnea \u2014Sleep apnea is a condition in which a person stops\nbreathing for short periods during sleep. During pregnancy, sleep apnea can cause\nfatigue and increase the risk of high blood pressure, preeclampsia, and heart and\nlung problems.\n\u2022\nHow can obesity affect a pregnancy?\nBirth defects \u2014Babies born to women who have obesity have an increased risk of\nhaving birth defects, such as heart defects and neural tube defects (NTDs) .\n\u2022\nProblems with diagnostic tests\u2014Having too much body fat can make it difficult to\nsee certain problems with the fetus\u2019s anatomy on an ultrasound exam . Checking the\nfetus\u2019s heart rate during labor may also be more difficult.\n\u2022\nMacrosomia \u2014In this condition, the fetus is larger than normal. This can increase the\nrisk of injury during birth. For example, the fetus\u2019s shoulder can get stuck after the\nhead is delivered. Macrosomia also increases the risk of cesarean birth. Infants born\nwith too much body fat have a greater chance of having obesity later in life.\n\u2022\nPreterm  birth\u2014Problems associated with obesity, such as preeclampsia, may lead to\na medically indicated preterm birth. This means that the baby is delivered early for a\nmedical reason. Preterm babies are not as fully developed as babies who are born\nafter 39 weeks of pregnancy. As a result, preterm babies have an increased risk of\nshort-term and long-term health problems.\n\u2022\nStillbirth \u2014The higher your BMI, the greater the risk of stillbirth.\n\u2022\n\nLosing weight before you get pregnant is the best way to decrease the risk of problems\ncaused by obesity. If you\u2019re overweight, losing even a small amount of weight can\nimprove your overall health and pave the way for a healthier pregnancy.\nWeight loss happens when you use up more calories  than you take in. You can do this\nby getting regular exercise\u00a0and eating healthy foods. Still, losing weight can be difficult\nfor many people. Research on the best way to lose weight continues to evolve.\nYour obstetrician\u2013gynecologist (ob-gyn)  may refer you to a nutritionist to help you plan\na healthy diet. Also, the MyPlate website from the U.S. Department of Agriculture has\ninformation about healthy eating while pregnant or breastfeeding.\nIncreasing your physical activity is important if you want to lose weight. Aim to be\nmoderately active for 60 minutes or vigorously active for 30 minutes on most days of\nthe week. You do not have to do this amount all at once. For example, you can exercise\nfor 20 minutes three times a day. Pick something you like to do. Moderate-intensity\nactivities include biking, brisk walking, and gardening. Vigorous-intensity activities\ninclude jogging, swimming laps, and heavy yard work.\nIf you have tried to lose weight through diet changes and exercise and you still have a\nBMI of 30 or greater or a BMI of at least 27 with certain medical conditions, such as\ndiabetes or heart disease, weight-loss medications may be suggested. These\nmedications should not be taken if you are trying to get pregnant or are already\npregnant.\nBariatric surgery  may be an option for people who have a BMI of 40 or greater or a BMI\nbetween 35 and 39 with major health problems caused by obesity. If you have weight\nloss surgery, delay getting pregnant for 12 to 24 months after surgery, when you will\nhave the most rapid weight loss.\nShould I plan to lose weight before getting pregnant?\nHow can I lose weight safely?\nAre there medications to help me lose weight before getting pregnant?\nIs there surgery to help me lose weight before getting pregnant?\n\nIf you have had fertility problems, they may resolve on their own as you rapidly lose the\nexcess weight. It\u2019s important to be aware of this because the increase in fertility can\nlead to an unplanned pregnancy.\nSome types of bariatric surgery may affect how the body absorbs medications taken by\nmouth, including birth control pills. You may need to switch to another form of birth\ncontrol.\nMost people who have had bariatric surgery do well during pregnancy. When you get\npregnant after the surgery, your ob-gyn may monitor you for vitamin deficiencies. It may\nalso be suggested that you work with a nutritionist to learn how to meet your nutritional\nneeds during pregnancy.\nHealth During Pregnancy\nDespite the risks of obesity, you can still have a healthy pregnancy. It takes careful\nmanagement of your weight, attention to diet and exercise, regular prenatal care  to\nmonitor for complications, and special considerations for your labor and delivery.\nWhile you\u2019re pregnant, the food you eat fuels your body and helps your fetus grow.\nFinding a balance between eating healthy foods\u00a0and staying at a healthy weight is\nimportant for your health and your fetus's health. In the second and third trimesters, you\nneed an average of 300 extra calories a day\u2014about the amount of calories in a glass of\nskim milk and half of a sandwich. You can get help with planning a healthy diet by\ntalking to a nutrition counselor. You can also find help at the MyPlate website from the\nU.S. Department of Agriculture.\nIf you have never exercised before, pregnancy is a great time to start. Discuss your\nexercise plan with your ob-gyn to make sure it\u2019s safe. Begin with as little as 5 minutes of\nexercise a day and add 5 minutes each week. Your goal is to stay active for 30 minutes\non most or all days of the week.\nCan I still have a healthy pregnancy?\nHow can I plan healthy meals during pregnancy?\nHow much should I exercise during pregnancy?\n\nWalking is a good choice if you are new to exercise. Swimming is another good exercise\nduring pregnancy. The water supports your weight so you can avoid injury and muscle\nstrain. It also helps you stay cool. Read Exercise During Pregnancy for more advice.\nAt your first prenatal visit, your BMI should be calculated. A recommendation should be\nmade about the amount of weight you should gain throughout pregnancy.\nYour weight should be checked at each prenatal visit. The growth of your fetus is also\nchecked. If you are gaining less than the recommended guidelines, and if your fetus is\ngrowing well, you do not have to increase your weight gain to catch up to the guidelines.\nIf your fetus is not growing well, changes may need to be made to your diet and exercise\nplan.\nLabor, Delivery, and Postpartum Care\nPain relief during labor and delivery may take special planning if you have obesity.\nBefore you have your baby, you may meet with a health care professional to discuss\nyour pain relief options.\nAlso, women who are overweight\u00a0 have longer labors than women of normal weight. It\ncan be harder to monitor the fetus during labor. For these reasons, obesity during\npregnancy increases the likelihood of having a cesarean birth.\nIf a cesarean birth is needed, obesity can increase the risks of infection, bleeding, and\nother complications. Steps can be taken to reduce your risk of these complications. For\nexample, you may wear inflatable cuffs on your legs before, during, and after surgery to\nhelp prevent blood clots.\nOnce you are home with your new baby, try to stick to your healthy eating\u00a0and\nexercise\u00a0habits to reach a normal weight. Breastfeeding is recommended for the first\nyear of a baby\u2019s life. Breastfeeding is good for you and your baby. It may also help with\nHow will my weight be monitored during pregnancy?\nHow does obesity affect labor and delivery?\nHow can I manage my weight after my baby is born?\n\npostpartum weight loss. Overall, women who breastfeed their babies for at least a few\nmonths tend to lose pregnancy weight faster than women who do not breastfeed.\nIt can be hard to lose the weight you gained during pregnancy. Weight can add up with\neach pregnancy. It helps to give yourself enough time to recover from pregnancy and\nlose excess weight before you get pregnant again.

Read ACOG\u2019s complete disclaimer.\n\nTerms and Conditions of Use\n\n\nPreeclampsia and High Blood Pressure\nDuring Pregnancy\nBlood Pressure\nBlood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of blood vessels called\narteries . The arteries bring blood from the heart to your lungs, where it picks up\noxygen \u00a0and then moves to your organs and tissues. The organs and tissues use the\noxygen to power their activities. Blood vessels called veins \u00a0return the blood to the\nheart.\nHigh blood pressure  (also called hypertension ) can lead to health problems at any\ntime in life. High blood pressure usually does not cause symptoms. During pregnancy,\nsevere or uncontrolled high blood pressure can cause problems for you and your fetus .\nSome women have high blood pressure before they get pregnant. Others develop it for\nthe first time during pregnancy. A serious high blood pressure disorder called\npreeclampsia \u00a0can also happen during pregnancy or soon after childbirth.\nA blood pressure reading has two numbers separated by a slash. A blood pressure\nreading of 110/80 mm Hg, for example, is referred to as \u201c110 over 80.\u201d The first number\nFAQs\nWhat is blood pressure?\nWhy is high blood pressure a problem during pregnancy?\nWhat do the blood pressure numbers mean?\n\nis the pressure against the artery walls when the heart contracts. This is called the\nsystolic blood pressure . The second number is the pressure against the artery walls\nwhen the heart relaxes between contractions. This is called the diastolic blood\npressure .\nYour obstetrician\u2013gynecologist (ob-gyn) \u00a0should check your blood pressure at each\nprenatal care \u00a0visit. Blood pressure changes often during the day. If you have one high\nreading, another reading may be taken later during your office visit.\nChronic Hypertension\nChronic hypertension  is high blood pressure that a woman has before getting pregnant\nor that develops in the first half of pregnancy (before 20 weeks of pregnancy). If you\nwere taking blood pressure medication before you got pregnant\u2014even if your blood\npressure is currently normal\u2014you have been diagnosed with chronic hypertension.\nWhen you are pregnant, your body makes more blood to support the fetus\u2019s growth. If\nblood pressure goes up during pregnancy, it can place extra stress on your heart and\nkidneys . This can lead to heart disease, kidney disease, and stroke . High blood\npressure during pregnancy also increases the risk of preeclampsia, preterm \u00a0birth,\nplacental abruption , and cesarean birth .\nWhat are the guidelines for blood pressure?\nNormal: Less than 120/80 mm Hg\n\u2022\nElevated: Systolic between 120 and 129 mm Hg and diastolic less than 80 mm Hg\n\u2022\nStage 1 hypertension: Systolic between 130 and 139 mm Hg or diastolic between 80\nand 89 mm Hg\n\u2022\nStage 2 hypertension: Systolic at least 140 mm Hg or diastolic at least 90 mm Hg\n\u2022\nHow often should blood pressure be checked during pregnancy?\nWhat is chronic hypertension?\nHow does chronic hypertension affect a pregnant woman?\n\nHigh blood pressure may reduce blood flow to the placenta . As a result, the fetus may\nnot get enough of the nutrients \u00a0and oxygen needed to grow.\nIn the first half of pregnancy, blood pressure normally goes down. If your hypertension is\nmild, your blood pressure may stay that way or even return to normal during pregnancy.\nBut if your blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg or higher, your ob-gyn may recommend that\nyou start or continue taking blood pressure medication during pregnancy.\nYour blood pressure should be checked at every prenatal care visit. You may also need\nto monitor your blood pressure at home. Ultrasound exams \u00a0may be done throughout\npregnancy to track the growth of the fetus. If growth problems are suspected, you may\nhave other tests that monitor the health of the fetus. This testing usually begins in the\nthird trimester \u00a0of pregnancy.\nIf your condition remains stable, delivery 1 to 3 weeks before your due date (about 37\nweeks to 39 weeks of pregnancy) generally is recommended. If you or the fetus develop\ncomplications , delivery may be needed even earlier.\nAfter delivery, you will need to keep monitoring your blood pressure at home for 1 to 2\nweeks. Blood pressure often goes up in the weeks after childbirth. You may need to\nresume taking medication, or your medication dosage may need to be adjusted.\nTalk with your ob-gyn about blood pressure medications that are safe to take if you plan\nto breastfeed. Do not stop any medications without talking with your ob-gyn.\nGestational Hypertension\nHow does chronic hypertension affect a fetus?\nWhat is the treatment for chronic hypertension during pregnancy?\nHow will my health be monitored during pregnancy?\nWill I need to deliver early if I have chronic hypertension?\nWhat will happen after delivery if I have chronic hypertension?\nWhat is gestational hypertension?\n\nYou have gestational hypertension  when:\nMost women with gestational hypertension have only a small increase in blood\npressure. But some women develop severe hypertension (defined as systolic blood\npressure of 160 mm Hg or higher and/or diastolic blood pressure of 110 mm Hg or\nhigher). These women are at risk of very serious complications.\nAll women with gestational hypertension are monitored often (usually weekly) for signs\nof preeclampsia and to make sure that their blood pressure does not go too high.\nAlthough gestational hypertension usually goes away after childbirth, it may increase\nthe risk of developing high blood pressure in the future. If you had gestational\nhypertension, keep this risk in mind as you take care of your health. Healthy eating,\nweight loss, and regular exercise may help prevent high blood pressure in the future.\nPreeclampsia\nPreeclampsia is a serious disorder that can affect all the organs in your body. It usually\ndevelops after 20 weeks of pregnancy, often in the third trimester. When it develops\nbefore 34 weeks of pregnancy, it is called early-onset preeclampsia. It can also develop\nin the weeks after childbirth.\nIt is not clear why some women develop preeclampsia. Doctors refer to \"high risk\" and\n\"moderate risk\" of preeclampsia.\nYou have a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher and/or a diastolic blood\npressure of 90 mm Hg or higher.\n\u2022\nThe high blood pressure first happens after 20 weeks of pregnancy.\n\u2022\nYou had normal blood pressure before pregnancy.\n\u2022\nHow will my health be monitored if I have gestational hypertension?\nHow does gestational hypertension affect future health?\nWhat is preeclampsia?\nWhat are the risk factors for preeclampsia?\n\nFactors that may put you in the \u201chigh risk\u201d category include\nFactors that may put you in the \u201cmoderate risk\u201d category include\npreeclampsia in a past pregnancy\n\u2022\ncarrying more than one fetus (twins, triplets, or more)\n\u2022\nchronic hypertension\n\u2022\nkidney disease\n\u2022\ndiabetes mellitus\n\u2022\nautoimmune conditions, such as lupus  (systemic lupus erythematosus or SLE)\n\u2022\nhaving multiple moderate risk factors (see below)\n\u2022\nbeing pregnant for the first time\n\u2022\nbeing pregnant more than 10 years after your previous pregnancy\n\u2022\nbody mass index (BMI)  over 30\n\u2022\nfamily history of preeclampsia (mother or sister)\n\u2022\nbeing age 35 or older\n\u2022\ncomplications in previous pregnancies, such as having a baby with a low birth weight\n\u2022\nin vitro fertilization (IVF)\n\u2022\nBlack race (because of racism and inequities that increase risk of illness)\n\u2022\nlower income (because of inequities that increase risk of illness)\n\u2022\nHow does preeclampsia affect the body?\nPreeclampsia can lead to a condition that causes seizures and stroke.\n\u2022\nPreeclampsia can cause HELLP syndrome . HELLP stands for hemolysis, elevated\nliver enzymes, and low platelet count. HELLP syndrome damages or destroys red\nblood cells and interferes with blood clotting. It can also cause chest pain, abdominal\npain, and bleeding in the liver. HELLP syndrome is a medical emergency. Women can\ndie from HELLP syndrome. They can also have lifelong health problems from the\ncondition.\n\u2022\n\nFor women with preeclampsia, early delivery may be needed in some cases. Preterm\nbabies have an increased risk of problems with breathing, eating, staying warm, hearing,\nand vision. Some preterm complications last a lifetime and require ongoing medical\ncare.\nWomen who have had preeclampsia\u2014especially those whose babies were born preterm\n\u2014have an increased risk later in life of kidney disease, heart attack, stroke, and high\nblood pressure. Also, having preeclampsia once increases the risk of having it again in a\nfuture pregnancy.\nPreeclampsia can develop quietly without you being aware of it. Symptoms can include\nIf you have any of these symptoms, especially if they develop in the second half of\npregnancy, call your ob-gyn right away.\nA woman with preeclampsia whose condition is worsening will develop \u201csevere\nfeatures.\u201d Severe features include\nWill I need to deliver early if I have preeclampsia?\nHow does preeclampsia affect future health?\nWhat are the signs and symptoms of preeclampsia?\nswelling of face or hands\n\u2022\nheadache that will not go away\n\u2022\nseeing spots or changes in eyesight\n\u2022\npain in the upper abdomen or shoulder\n\u2022\nnausea and vomiting (in the second half of pregnancy)\n\u2022\nsudden weight gain\n\u2022\ndifficulty breathing\n\u2022\nlow number of platelets in the blood\n\u2022\nabnormal kidney or liver function\n\u2022\npain in the upper abdomen\n\u2022\nchanges in vision\n\u2022\nfluid in the lungs\n\nA high blood pressure reading may be the first sign of preeclampsia. If your blood\npressure reading is high, it may be checked again to confirm the results. You may have a\nurine test to check for protein. You may also have tests to check how your liver and\nkidneys are working and to measure the number of platelets in your blood.\nYou and your ob-gyn should talk about how your condition will be managed. The goal is\nto limit complications for you and to deliver the healthiest baby possible.\nWomen who have gestational hypertension or preeclampsia without severe features\nmay be treated in a hospital or as an outpatient. Being an outpatient means you can\nstay at home with close monitoring by your ob-gyn. You may need to keep track of your\nfetus\u2019s movement by doing a daily kick count . You may also need to measure your\nblood pressure at home. Visits to your ob-gyn may be once or twice a week.\nAt 37 weeks of pregnancy, you and your ob-gyn may talk about delivery. Labor may be\ninduced\u00a0(started with medications). If test results show that the fetus is not doing well,\nyou may need to have the baby earlier. Women with preeclampsia can have vaginal\ndeliveries, but if there are problems during labor, cesarean birth may be needed.\nIf you have preeclampsia with severe features, you may be treated in the hospital. If you\nare at least 34 weeks pregnant, you and your ob-gyn may talk about having your baby as\nsoon as your condition is stable.\nIf you are less than 34 weeks pregnant and your condition is stable, it may be possible\nto wait to deliver your baby. Delaying delivery for just a few days may be helpful in some\n\u2022 severe headache\n\u2022\nsystolic pressure of 160 mm Hg or higher or diastolic pressure of 110 mm Hg or\nhigher\n\u2022\nHow is preeclampsia diagnosed?\nHow is preeclampsia managed?\nHow is preeclampsia managed when there are no severe features?\nHow is preeclampsia managed when there are severe features?\n\ncases.

Some birth defects can be seen\nright after the baby is born, such as a clubfoot  or extra fingers or toes. Special tests\nmay be needed to find others, such as heart defects or hearing loss. Some birth defects\nare not noticed until later in life.\nSome birth defects are caused by genes  that can be passed from parents to children.\nOthers result from a problem with chromosomes . A small number of birth defects are\ncaused by exposure during pregnancy to certain medications, infections, and chemicals.\nFor many birth defects, the cause is not known.\nMost birth defects cannot be prevented because their cause is not known. For a few\nbirth defects, you may be able to decrease your risk by taking certain steps:\nFAQs\nWhat is a birth defect?\nWhat causes birth defects?\nWhat can I do before or during pregnancy to decrease my risk of having a baby\nwith certain birth defects?\nSee your doctor before getting pregnant.\n\u2022\nKnow your risk factors.\n\u2022\nTake a daily multivitamin before and during pregnancy.\n\u2022\nMaintain a healthy weight.\n\u2022\n\nScheduling a health care visit before getting pregnant is a good idea. You can get advice\nabout diet and exercise from your obstetrician\u2013gynecologist (ob-gyn)  or other health\ncare professional. You can talk about whether you have any factors that increase the\nrisk of having a child with a birth defect. If you have a medical condition, you can talk\nabout any special care that you may need before or during pregnancy.\nYou may be at an increased risk of having a baby with a birth defect if you:\nIf you have any risk factors, your ob-gyn or other health care professional may\nrecommend special tests or other steps that may help reduce your risk. For example, if\nyou have a personal or family history of birth defects, genetic counseling and testing\nmay be recommended.\nPrenatal vitamin supplements contain the recommended amounts of the vitamins and\nminerals you will need during your pregnancy, including:\nUse medications wisely.\n\u2022\nTake care of medical conditions before pregnancy.\n\u2022\nDo not use alcohol, marijuana, illegal drugs, or prescription drugs for a nonmedical\nreason.\n\u2022\nPrevent infections.\n\u2022\nAvoid known harmful agents.\n\u2022\nWhy should I see a health care professional before becoming pregnant?\nWhat factors increase the risk of having a baby with a birth defect?\nAre older\n\u2022\nHave a family or personal history of birth defects\n\u2022\nHave had a child with a birth defect\n\u2022\nUse certain medicines around the time you become pregnant\n\u2022\nHave a medical condition such as diabetes mellitus  or obesity\n\u2022\nUse recreational drugs or drink alcohol during pregnancy\n\u2022\nWhy is taking a multivitamin important before and during pregnancy?\n\nTaking 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid daily for at least 1 month before pregnancy\nand during pregnancy helps prevent major birth defects called neural tube defects\n(NTDs) . These are defects of the brain and spine of the fetus . Most prenatal and\n\u201cwomen\u2019s formula\u201d multivitamin supplements contain 400\u2013800 mcg of folic acid.\nA few medications have been linked to birth defects. You should tell anyone who\nprescribes drugs for you that you are pregnant or thinking about getting pregnant. This\nincludes doctors you may see for dental care, mental health care, or other nonpregnancy\nproblems. Also, check with your ob-gyn or other health care professional before taking\nany over-the-counter drug, such as pain relievers, laxatives, cold or allergy remedies,\nvitamins, herbal products, and skin treatments. A good source for information about the\nsafety or risk of specific drugs during pregnancy is the website of the Organization of\nTeratology Information Specialists: www.mothertobaby.org.\nWomen who are obese (defined as having a body mass index [BMI]  of 30 or greater)\nwhen they get pregnant have an increased risk of having babies with certain birth\ndefects than women who are a normal weight. Among the most common obesity-\nrelated birth defects are NTDs, heart defects, and cleft palate . If you are planning a\npregnancy, the best way to prevent problems caused by obesity is to be at a normal\nweight before you get pregnant.\nSome medical conditions\u2014such as diabetes, high blood pressure , and seizure\ndisorders \u2014may increase the risk of having a baby with certain birth defects. If you have\na medical condition, see your ob-gyn or other health care professional to discuss any\nVvitamins A, C, and D\n\u2022\nFolic acid\n\u2022\nMinerals such as iron\n\u2022\nWhat do I need to know about taking medications during pregnancy?\nHow can obesity have an impact on my pregnancy?\nI have certain medical conditions. Why is it important to talk with my ob-gyn or\nother health care professional if I am thinking about getting pregnant?\n\nchanges you need to make in your diet, medication, or other areas to bring the condition\nunder control before you try to get pregnant.\nAlcohol can interfere with the normal growth of the fetus and cause birth defects. When\na woman drinks during pregnancy, her fetus can develop physical, intellectual,\nbehavioral, and learning disabilities that can last a lifetime. It is best not to drink at all\nduring pregnancy. If it is hard for you to stop drinking, talk with your ob-gyn or other\nhealth care professional or contact Alcoholics Anonymous on its website: www.aa.org.\nUsing substances\u2014including heroin, cocaine, methamphetamines, and prescription\ndrugs taken for a nonmedical reason\u2014is a widespread problem in the United States.\nUsing illegal drugs early in pregnancy can cause birth defects and miscarriage . During\nthe later weeks of pregnancy, illegal drugs can interfere with the growth of the fetus and\ncause preterm  birth and fetal death. Infants born to women who used illegal drugs\nduring pregnancy may need specialized care after birth. If you need help quitting illegal\ndrugs, you can find resources at the website of Narcotics Anonymous: www.na.org.\nRecreational marijuana used during pregnancy is associated with attention and\nbehavioral problems in children. Marijuana may increase the risk of stillbirth  and the\nrisk that babies will be smaller than babies who are not exposed to marijuana before\nbirth. Medical marijuana also should be avoided. The American College of Obstetricians\nand Gynecologists recommends that pregnant women and those planning to become\npregnant not use any form of marijuana. You and your ob-gyn or other health care\nprofessional can discuss alternative treatments that will be safe for your fetus.\nOpioids  are a type of medication that relieves pain. Doctors may prescribe opioids for\npeople who have had surgery, dental work, or an injury. Prescribed opioids include\noxycodone, hydromorphone, hydrocodone, and codeine. When taken under a doctor\u2019s\ncare, opioids are safe for both you and your fetus. It is important to take the medication\nonly as prescribed.\nWhy is it important for me to not drink alcohol during pregnancy?\nHow can recreational drug use affect my pregnancy?\nCan using marijuana affect my pregnancy?\nHow can opioids affect my pregnancy?\n\nMost people who use a prescription opioid have no trouble stopping their use, but some\npeople develop an addiction. Misusing opioids during pregnancy can increase the risk of\nserious complications , including preterm birth, stillbirth, and problems with the\nplacenta and fetal growth. If you need help with an opioid addiction, you can find\nresources at the website of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services\nAdministration (SAMHSA): www.samhsa.gov. SAMHSA also has a 24 hour treatment\nreferral line: 800-662-HELP (4357).\nSome infections can increase the risk of birth defects and other problems during\npregnancy for you and your fetus:\nWhat infections should I be concerned about and how can I reduce my risk of\ngetting them during pregnancy?\nRubella  (German measles) is a viral infection that usually causes a mild rash and a\nlow fever. Having rubella during pregnancy can cause miscarriage  or result in\ndeafness, intellectual disability, heart defects, and blindness in a newborn. There is a\nvaccine  against rubella, but it is not recommended for pregnant women. If you have\nnot already had the disease or been vaccinated, you should be vaccinated against\nrubella and wait at least 1 month before becoming pregnant.\n\u2022\nToxoplasmosis  is a disease caused by a parasite that lives in soil. You can become\ninfected by eating raw or undercooked meat or unwashed vegetables or by coming\ninto contact with animal feces, especially from cats that go outdoors. If you are\ninfected for the first time while you are pregnant, you can pass the disease on to your\nbaby. Toxoplasmosis can cause birth defects, including hearing loss, vision\nproblems, and intellectual disability. Make sure that you eat well-cooked meat and\nwear gloves while gardening or handling unwashed vegetables. If you have an\noutdoor cat that uses a litter box, have someone else empty it. If you must empty the\nlitter box, use gloves and wash your hands well after doing so.\n\u2022\nSexually transmitted infections (STIs)  can cause serious birth defects. Treating an\nSTI\u2014preferably before you get pregnant\u2014may prevent or reduce harm to the fetus.\n\u2022\nCytomegalovirus (CMV) , is a common viral infection. Most CMV infections cause no\nsignificant problems. If you are infected for the first time when you are pregnant,\nCMV can infect the fetus. In a small number of cases, the infection can cause\nintellectual disability, hearing loss, and vision problems. CMV can be spread by\ncontact with an infected child\u2019s urine or other body fluids. Pregnant women who work\nwith young children, such as day care workers or health care workers, should take\n\u2022\n\nZika virus can be transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito or through sex\nwith an infected partner. To avoid Zika virus, take strict steps to avoid mosquito bites. If\nyour male partner lives in or travels to an area where Zika virus is spreading, use a\ncondom each time you have sex. Do not travel to areas where Zika virus is known to be\nactive.\nIf you or your partner must travel to an area where Zika virus is active, strictly follow\nthese four steps to prevent mosquito bites:\nA few precautions that are recommended for all pregnant women include the following:\nsteps to prevent infection, including wearing gloves when changing diapers. Frequent\nhandwashing also is recommended. Pregnant women with young children at home\nalso are at risk and should take these steps.\nZika  virus has been found in South America, Central America, and North America.\nInfection with the virus during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects, including\nmicrocephaly  (a birth defect in which a baby\u2019s head and brain are smaller than\nnormal) and other brain abnormalities. These birth defects can lead to lifelong\nproblems, including seizures, feeding problems, hearing loss, vision problems, and\nlearning difficulties. There still are many things that researchers do not know about\nZika virus.\n\u2022\nUse EPA-registered bug spray with DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus,\nparamenthane-diol, or 2-undecanone. Used as directed, these sprays are safe for\npregnant and breastfeeding women.\n1.\nWear long-sleeved shirts and long pants.\n2.\nTreat clothing and gear with permethrin or buy permethrin-treated items.\n3.\nStay in air-conditioned or screened-in areas during the day and at night. Follow\nthese steps at all times. Mosquitoes are active during the day and night.\n4.\nWhat precautions can I take to limit my exposure to agents that can cause birth\ndefects?\nLimit your exposure to mercury by not eating bigeye tuna, king mackerel, marlin,\norange roughy, shark, swordfish, or tilefish. Limit eating white (albacore) tuna to 6\nounces a week. You do not have to avoid all fish during pregnancy.

After two\nmiscarriages, a thorough physical exam and testing are recommended.\nA small number of women have repeated miscarriages. It\u2019s estimated that fewer than 5\nin 100 have two miscarriages in a row.\nPossible Causes\nAbout half of miscarriages occur randomly when an embryo  receives an abnormal\nnumber of chromosomes  during fertilization . This type of genetic problem happens by\nchance. There is no medical condition that causes it. But the chance of this problem\nincreases with age.\nFAQs\nWhat is recurrent pregnancy loss?\nWhat is the likelihood of having repeated miscarriages?\nWhat is the most common cause of miscarriage?\nCan other genetic problems cause repeated miscarriages?\n\nIn a small number of couples who have repeated miscarriages, one partner has a\nchromosome in which a piece is transferred to another chromosome. This is called a\ntranslocation .\nPeople who have a translocation usually do not have any physical signs or symptoms,\nbut some of their eggs  or sperm  will have abnormal chromosomes. If an embryo gets\ntoo much or too little genetic material, it often leads to a miscarriage.\nSome medical conditions may increase the risk of repeated miscarriages:\nIn more than half of women with repeated miscarriages, no cause can be found for the\npregnancy loss. There may be clues about what the problem is, but there is no sure\nanswer.\nTests and Treatment\nCan medical conditions increase the risk of repeated miscarriages?\nCertain congenital  problems of the uterus \u2014Although there are many such\ndisorders, one of the most common that has been linked to miscarriage is a septate\nuterus. In this condition, the uterus is partially divided into two sections by a wall of\ntissue.\n\u2022\nAsherman syndrome\u2014This condition causes adhesions  and scarring in the uterus.\n\u2022\nFibroids and polyps\u2014These are benign (noncancer) growths of the uterus.\n\u2022\nAntiphospholipid syndrome (APS) \u2014This autoimmune disorder  that affects blood\nclotting can cause a variety of medical problems. APS can occur alone or with other\nautoimmune diseases, such as lupus .\n\u2022\nDiabetes mellitus \u2014Diabetes, especially if the disease is poorly controlled, can\nincrease the risk of pregnancy loss. Keeping blood sugar levels in the normal range\nbefore pregnancy and throughout pregnancy can decrease the risk.\n\u2022\nThyroid disease\u2014Problems with the thyroid gland  that are not treated can increase\nthe risk of miscarriage. Treating thyroid problems can decrease the risk.\n\u2022\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\n\u2022\nHow common are unexplained repeated miscarriages?\n\nTo help find the cause of repeated miscarriages, your health care professional should\nask about your medical history and past pregnancies. A complete physical exam,\nincluding a pelvic exam , may be done.\nYou may have blood tests to detect problems with the immune system. Testing may be\ndone to help detect genetic causes of repeated miscarriages. Imaging tests may be\nconsidered to find out if a uterine problem is causing repeated miscarriages.\nEven if no cause is found, the chances of having a successful pregnancy without special\ntreatment are good. About 65 in 100 women with unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss\nhave a successful next pregnancy.\nIf a specific cause of your repeated miscarriages can be identified, your health care\nprofessional may suggest a treatment that addresses the cause.\nIf you have a chromosome translocation, genetic counseling may be recommended.\nResults of genetic testing can help clarify your options. In vitro fertilization (IVF)  with\nspecial genetic testing called preimplantation genetic testing  may be done to select\nunaffected embryos. IVF can also be done with donor eggs, or intrauterine insemination\n(IUI)  can be done with donor sperm.\nCorrective surgery may be able to increase the chances for a successful pregnancy. For\nexample, a septum in the uterus can be removed.\nWhat tests and exams are available to help find the cause of repeated\nmiscarriages?\nWhat are my chances of having a successful pregnancy if I have repeated\nmiscarriages and no cause is found?\nIs treatment available if the cause of my repeated miscarriages can be found?\nWhat can be done if I have a chromosome translocation?\nHow can problems with reproductive organs be treated?\nWhat treatment is available if I have antiphospholipid syndrome?\n\nUse of a medication that prevents blood clots, such as heparin, sometimes combined\nwith low-dose aspirin, may be prescribed throughout pregnancy and for a few weeks\nafterward. This treatment can increase the rates of successful pregnancy.\nFinding Support and Trying Again\nIt\u2019s normal to feel grief after the loss of a pregnancy. In most cases, physical recovery\nfrom miscarriage takes only a few hours to a couple of days, but the grieving process\ncan take longer. When you have had repeated miscarriages, you may feel like you did\nsomething to make the miscarriages happen. It\u2019s important to remember that\nmiscarriages are almost never caused by anything you did or did not do.\nYour feelings of grief may differ from those of your partner. You are the one who has felt\nthe physical changes of pregnancy. Your partner may also grieve but may not express\nfeelings in the same way you do. If either of you is having trouble handling the feelings\nthat go along with a pregnancy loss, talk with a health care professional, such as your\nobstetrician\u2013gynecologist (ob-gyn)  or a therapist.\nYou may want to reach out to those closest to you and ask for their comfort and\nsupport. When you visit your ob-gyn for follow-up care, talk about how you are feeling\nand any other issues related to your pregnancy losses. Sometimes, further counseling\nor referral to a support group in your area can help you and your partner cope.\nYou may want to take time to recover emotionally before trying again. But you can\novulate and get pregnant as soon as 2 weeks after an early miscarriage. Talk with your\nob-gyn about the best timing for trying again.\nIf you decide to get pregnant again, it\u2019s a good idea to be as healthy as possible\nbeforehand. The following is standard advice given to everyone planning a pregnancy:\nWhat should I know about coping with repeated miscarriages?\nWhat should I know if I\u2019m thinking about trying again?\nSee your ob-gyn for a prepregnancy care checkup.\n\u2022\nTake 400 micrograms of folic acid  as a daily dietary supplement.\n\u2022\nFollow a healthy diet and get 30 minutes of exercise on most days of the week.\n\u2022\n\nYou may also decide not to try to get pregnant again. No choice is right or wrong. You\nshould decide what is best for you.\nResources and Glossary\nRISE Pregnancy Loss\nResearchers are working to understand how genetics can affect or cause recurrent\npregnancy loss.

Some of these tests are\ndone with a blood sample. Others use a urine sample or a sample of fluid taken from\nyour vagina , cervix , or rectum . These tests can help find conditions that may\nincrease the risk of complications  for you and your fetus . Many problems found by\nthese tests can be treated during pregnancy.\nTests Done Early in Pregnancy\nSeveral routine lab tests are done early in pregnancy, including\nAlso, pregnant women typically are tested for specific diseases and infections early in\npregnancy, including\nFAQs\nWhat tests are done early in pregnancy?\ncomplete blood count (CBC)\n\u2022\nblood type and Rh factor\n\u2022\nurinalysis\n\u2022\nurine culture\n\u2022\nrubella\n\u2022\nhepatitis B  and hepatitis C\n\u2022\nhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\n\u2022\nother sexually transmitted infections (STIs)\n\u2022\n\nA CBC counts the number of different types of cells  that make up your blood. The\nnumber of red blood cells can show whether you have a certain type of anemia . The\nnumber of white blood cells can show how many disease-fighting cells are in your\nblood. The number of platelets can reveal whether you have a problem with blood\nclotting.\nYes, during the first trimester  of pregnancy you will have a blood test to find out your\nblood type, such as type A or type B. Also, your blood will be tested for the Rh factor.\nThe Rh factor is a protein that can be found on the surface of red blood cells. If your\nblood cells have this protein, you are Rh positive. If your blood cells do not have this\nprotein, you are Rh negative. The \u201cpositive\u201d or \u201cnegative\u201d part of your blood type, such as\nO positive or A negative, refers to your Rh status.\nIf you are Rh negative and your fetus is Rh positive, your body can make antibodies\nagainst the Rh factor. These antibodies can damage the fetus\u2019s red blood cells. This\nusually does not cause problems in a first pregnancy, when your body makes only a\nsmall number of antibodies. But it can cause serious issues in a later pregnancy,\nincluding stillbirth .\nIf you are Rh negative, you may be given medication during pregnancy to help prevent\nthe development of Rh antibodies. If you are Rh negative and have already made a\ncertain number of Rh antibodies, you might need special tests and monitoring\nthroughout pregnancy. Your baby may also need treatment after birth.\ntuberculosis (TB)\n\u2022\nWhat does a complete blood count test for?\nWill I be tested for blood type?\nWhat is the Rh factor?\nWhy is it important to know your Rh status?\nWhat will happen if I am Rh negative?\n\nRead The Rh Factor: How It Can Affect Your Pregnancy to learn more.\nA urinalysis is a quick test of your urine for\nThis test also measures the amount of protein in your blood, which can be compared to\nlevels later in pregnancy. High protein levels may signal kidney disease\nor\u00a0 preeclampsia , a serious complication that can occur later in pregnancy or after the\nbaby is born.\nThis test looks for bacteria  in your urine, which can be a sign of a UTI. This test is done\nbecause sometimes UTIs do not cause symptoms.\nIt can take several days to get the results of this test. If the test shows bacteria in your\nurine, you should be treated with antibiotics . After you finish treatment, you may have a\nrepeat test to see if the bacteria are gone.\nRubella (sometimes called German measles) can cause birth defects  if you are\ninfected during pregnancy. Your blood can show whether you have been infected with\nrubella or if you have been vaccinated against this disease. If you had this infection\nbefore or you have been vaccinated against rubella, you are immune  to the disease.\nRubella is easily spread. If your blood test shows you are not immune, avoid anyone who\nhas the disease while you are pregnant. There is a vaccine, but it contains a live virus\nand is not recommended during pregnancy. If you have not been vaccinated, you can get\nthe measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine  after the baby is born.\nWhat is a urinalysis?\nred blood cells, a possible sign of a urinary tract disease\n\u2022\nwhite blood cells, a possible sign of a urinary tract infection (UTI)\n\u2022\nglucose , because high levels of blood sugar can be a sign of diabetes\n\u2022\nWhat is a urine culture?\nWhy is testing for rubella done?\nWhat if I\u2019m not immune to rubella?\n\nHepatitis is a virus that infects the liver. If you are pregnant and have hepatitis B or\nhepatitis C, you can pass the virus to your fetus. Everyone should be tested for hepatitis\nB and hepatitis C infection during pregnancy.\nIf you are infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis C, you might need special care during\npregnancy. Your baby may also need special care after birth. You can breastfeed if you\nhave either infection. A vaccine is available to protect the baby against hepatitis B. The\nvaccine is given as a series of three shots, with the first dose given to the baby within a\nfew hours of birth. Read Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C in Pregnancy to learn more.\nHIV attacks cells of the body\u2019s immune system and causes acquired immunodeficiency\nsyndrome (AIDS)  if not treated. If you have HIV, there is a chance you could pass it to\nyour fetus.\nWhile you are pregnant, you can take medication that can greatly reduce the risk of\npassing HIV to your fetus. You can also get specialized care to ensure that you stay as\nhealthy as possible throughout your pregnancy. This is why everyone is tested for HIV\nearly in pregnancy. Read HIV and Pregnancy to learn more.\nYou should be tested for syphilis three times during pregnancy: at your first prenatal\nvisit, in the third trimester, and at delivery.\u00a0\nYou should be tested for chlamydia  and gonorrhea if you are under age 25 or if you are\nat increased risk for getting STIs.\nThese tests are done early in pregnancy because these infections can cause serious\nproblems for you and your fetus.\nWhat is hepatitis?\nWhat if I have hepatitis during pregnancy?\nWhy is it important to have a test for HIV?\nWhat if I have HIV?\nWhat other STI tests are done?\nWhat if I have syphilis, chlamydia, or gonorrhea?\n\nIf you have syphilis, chlamydia, or gonorrhea, you should be treated during pregnancy\nand tested again to see if the treatment has worked. Your sex partner or partners should\nalso be treated to prevent you from getting infected again.\nPeople who are at high risk of TB should be tested for it. Those at high risk include\npeople who are infected with HIV, live in close contact with someone who has TB, or are\nfrom a country with high rates of TB. \u00a0\nTests Done Later in Pregnancy\nThe tests done later in pregnancy include glucose screening and group B streptococcus\n(GBS)  screening.\nThis test measures the level of glucose, or sugar, in your blood. A high blood sugar level\nmay be a sign of gestational diabetes , which can cause problems during pregnancy.\nFor this test, you drink a special sugar mixture. An hour later, a blood sample is taken\nand sent to a lab. If your blood sugar level is high, you should have another type of\nglucose test to confirm the results.\nThis test usually is done between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. This test might be\ndone in the first trimester of pregnancy if you have risk factors for diabetes or had\ngestational diabetes in a past pregnancy.\nGBS is one of the many bacteria that live in the body. It usually does not cause serious\nillness in adults, and it is not an STI.\nWho should be tested for tuberculosis (TB)?\nWhat tests are done later in pregnancy?\nWhat is a glucose screening test?\nWhen is a glucose screening done?\nWhat is group B strep (GBS)?\nWhy is GBS a concern during pregnancy?\n\nIn women, GBS is most often found in the vagina and rectum. This means that GBS can\npass from you to your fetus during labor. This is rare. It happens to 1 or 2 babies out of\n100 when the mother does not receive treatment with antibiotics during labor. The\nchance of a newborn getting sick is much lower when the mother receives treatment.\nEven though it is rare for a baby to get GBS, it can be very serious when it happens. A\nsmall number of babies with GBS die even with immediate treatment.\nThe test for GBS is called a culture. It is done between 36 and 38 weeks of pregnancy.\nFor this test, a swab is used to take a sample from the vagina and rectum.\nIf the results show that GBS is present, antibiotics should be given through an\nintravenous (IV) line  once labor has started. This is done to help protect the fetus from\nbeing infected. The best time for treatment is during labor. Read Group B Strep and\nPregnancy to learn more.\nGenetic Testing for Birth Defects\nScreening for birth defects begins by assessing your risk factors. Early in your\npregnancy, your obstetrician\u2013gynecologist (ob-gyn) \u00a0may give you a list of questions to\nfind out whether you have risk factors. If you do have risk factors, you might want to see\na genetic counselor  for more detailed information about your risks.\nMost babies with birth defects are born to couples without risk factors. But the risk of\nbirth defects is higher when certain factors are present. Risk factors include\nHow can GBS affect a newborn?\nHow is the test for GBS done?\nWhat is the first step to screen for birth defects during pregnancy?\nWhat factors increase the risk of birth defects?\nhaving a personal or family history of birth defects\n\u2022\nbelonging to certain ethnic groups\n\u2022\nbeing 35 or older\n\u2022\n\nWhen done during pregnancy, screening tests\u00a0can tell you the chances that the fetus\nmay be at risk for certain common birth defects. A screening test cannot tell whether\nthe fetus actually has a birth defect. There is no risk to the fetus from screening tests.\nDiagnostic tests can detect many, but not all, birth defects caused by defects in a gene\nor chromosomes . You can choose to have diagnostic tests instead of or in addition to\nscreening tests. Some diagnostic tests carry risks, including a small risk of pregnancy\nloss.\nNo, screening and testing are a personal choice. Some people would rather not know if\nthey are at risk of having a child with a birth defect or whether their child will have a birth\ndefect. Others want to know in advance.\nKnowing beforehand allows the option of deciding not to continue the pregnancy. If you\nchoose to continue the pregnancy, knowing beforehand gives you time to prepare for\nhaving a child with a disorder. This means you can organize the medical care your child\nmay need. Talk with your ob-gyn or genetic counselor about your test results.\n[3 Questions to Ask Yourself Before Getting Prenatal Genetic Testing]\nAcquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS): A group of signs and symptoms, usually\nof severe infections, in a person who has human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\nAnemia: Abnormally low levels of red blood cells in the bloodstream.\u00a0\nAntibiotics: Medications that treat or decrease the risk of certain infections caused by\nbacteria.\nhaving diabetes before pregnancy\n\u2022\nWhat is the difference between screening and diagnostic testing for birth\ndefects?\nAm I required to have screening or testing for birth defects?\nGlossary\n\nAntibodies: Proteins in the blood that the body makes in reaction to foreign substances,\nsuch as bacteria and viruses.\nBacteria: One-celled organisms that can cause infections in the human body.\nBirth Defects: Physical problems that are present at birth.\nCells: The smallest units of structures in the body.

They want to do\neverything they can to protect their pregnancy, and there is a lot to think about.\nExpert View\n\ue921\n\nEach week can come with new symptoms, confusing advice from friends and\nfamily, and potential reasons to worry.\nAs an ob-gyn, here are the questions I most often hear from patients\u2014and the\nanswers that can help them have a healthy pregnancy.\n1. Are there any foods I should avoid during pregnancy?\nThis is the number one question I get. There are wonderful resources online that\ncover healthy eating (visit Nutrition During Pregnancy, for one). What it boils\ndown to is this: You don\u2019t want to eat something that might contain bacteria\u00a0that\ncould make you sick. Pregnant women are more likely to get very sick from\nbacteria in food, which can be dangerous for you and your pregnancy.\nRisky foods include raw or undercooked meat, fish, and eggs. To avoid\nproblems, cook food thoroughly and wash your hands, knives, and cutting\nboards after handling raw meat or fish. Avoid homemade mayonnaise and\ndressings that use raw eggs. Cook scrambled eggs thoroughly.\nAvoid raw sprouts, including bean and alfalfa. The moist conditions they\u2019re\ngrown in are ideal for bacteria growth. Don\u2019t eat unpasteurized (raw) milk and\ncheeses, such as some feta, queso fresco, and blue cheeses. Deli meats and hot\ndogs should be thoroughly cooked or microwaved to kill any bacteria.\nCooked seafood is a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, an important nutrient\nfor your pregnancy. But certain fish should be avoided because they have high\nlevels of mercury. Do not eat bigeye tuna, king mackerel, marlin, orange roughy,\nshark, swordfish, or tilefish. Limit white (albacore) tuna to 6 ounces or less a\nweek. Here\u2019s a list with safer options.\nAlso, fish caught in local rivers or lakes can be unsafe because of chemicals in\nthe water. In my area, for example, there\u2019s mercury runoff from old gold mines.\nIt\u2019s best to avoid eating fish caught locally unless you can check local safety\n\ninformation. Otherwise, eat no more than 6 ounces of it and avoid eating other\nfish that week.\n2. Can I keep drinking coffee?\nThere has been research on whether caffeine increases the risk of miscarriage\nor preterm birth, but the results are unclear. Most experts agree it\u2019s safe to drink\nabout one cup of coffee a day\u2014that\u2019s 12 ounces (200 milligrams) of caffeine.\nPay attention to tea, chocolate, soft drinks, and other caffeine sources when\nyou\u2019re calculating how much you\u2019re taking in.\n3. Can I keep exercising? Or can I start a new exercise\nroutine?\nIf you\u2019re already active, we encourage you to continue exercising. We\nrecommend 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week, for 150\nminutes total each week. Walking, swimming, and yoga are some of the safest\nexercises you can do while pregnant. (Read Exercise During Pregnancy\u00a0to learn\nmore.) Just talk with your ob-gyn first, as there are some medical conditions\nthat may make exercise riskier.\nSome sports should be avoided, primarily if there\u2019s a risk of falling or impact to\nthe abdomen. These sports include skiing, off-road cycling, and contact sports\nlike soccer or basketball. Also avoid gymnastics, horseback riding, scuba diving,\nand skydiving. And it\u2019s best to avoid activities where you are lying on your back\nfor more than 10 minutes.\nIf you haven\u2019t been active, talk about your plan with your ob-gyn. Start out slow,\nwith 10 to 15 minutes of exercise, and add 5 minutes a week. Walking may be\nthe easiest thing to do. When you work up to 30 minutes, walking can do\nwonders for your health. I recommend patients add 30-second intervals of\nfaster walking once they\u2019ve worked up to it.\nA lot of my patients are runners who continue to run when they get pregnant.\nThe main thing is to listen to your body. If it hurts or doesn\u2019t feel right, stop. One\n\npatient did half marathons, got pregnant, and continued training. Her growing\nbelly and pelvic pressure made running increasingly uncomfortable, so she cut\nback on the training. Give yourself permission to cut back or stop when\nnecessary.\n4. How much kicking should I feel? When should I be\nconcerned?\nI bring this up all the time with my patients because I know new moms get\nworried. Most first-time moms won\u2019t feel any movement (kicking) until about 5\nmonths of pregnancy. With a second pregnancy, you typically feel movement\nearlier because you\u2019re more familiar with what it feels like.\nOnce you start feeling the fetus move, you should feel something every day until\nabout 7 months.\nIf you start to feel less movement than what you think is normal, you can ask\nyour ob-gyn if they recommend kick counts. This is a test where you time how\nlong it takes for you to feel 10 movements. Do the counts after your biggest\nmeal of the day, because that\u2019s typically when there is the most movement.\nIf you haven\u2019t felt 10 kicks within 2 hours, call your ob-gyn. There may not be a\nproblem, but more tests may be needed to be sure.\n5. Do I really need to sleep on my left side? Can I sleep\non my belly?\nA lot of women read online that they should sleep on their left side throughout\ntheir entire pregnancy, but that\u2019s difficult and not necessary. You can sleep on\neither side, right or left.\nYou just want to avoid sleeping on your back later in pregnancy. As your belly\ngrows, sleeping on your back puts more pressure on the blood vessels that\nsupply blood to your uterus. If you find yourself sleeping on your back in your\nsecond or third trimester, don\u2019t panic. Just turn to one side or the other.\n\nYou can sleep on your belly, but you\u2019ll get to a point where it\u2019s just not possible.\n6. Is it normal to be short of breath?\nYes, it\u2019s perfectly normal. You may find you can go up a flight of stairs with very\nlittle effort, but you are short of breath. Shortness of breath can start early in\npregnancy\u2014it has to do with how pregnancy hormones affect the lungs. But if\nyou have shortness of breath along with chest pain, a cough, or heart\npalpitations, if you\u2019re feeling faint, or if there\u2019s a major change in your breathing,\nthen you need to contact your ob-gyn.\nOf course, you can call your ob-gyn at any time\u2014whenever you have any\nquestions or concerns. We are always here to help.\nPublished: April 2022\nLast reviewed: February 2024\nCopyright 2025 by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

She is a Fellow of\nthe American College of Obstetricians and\nGynecologists.\n\n\nTobacco, Alcohol, Drugs, and Pregnancy\nFrequently Asked Questions\nDuring pregnancy, women should not use tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, illegal drugs, or\nprescription medications for nonmedical reasons. Avoiding these substances and\ngetting regular prenatal care  are important to having a healthy pregnancy and a healthy\nbaby. Counseling and treatment are available if you have hard time quitting unhealthy\nsubstances on your own.\nWhen a woman smokes cigarettes during pregnancy, her fetus  is exposed to many\nharmful chemicals. Nicotine is one of 4,000 chemicals that can pass from a pregnant\nwoman to her fetus.\nNicotine damages a fetus\u2019s brain and lungs. This damage is permanent. Nicotine also\ncauses blood vessels to narrow, so less oxygen and fewer nutrients  reach the fetus.\nSmoking during pregnancy increases the risk of preterm  birth. Babies that are born too\nearly may not be fully developed. They may be born with serious health problems. Some\nFAQs\nWhat substances should I avoid during pregnancy?\nHow does nicotine affect pregnancy?\nWhat problems can happen if I smoke during pregnancy?\n\nhealth problems, like cerebral palsy , can last a lifetime. Other problems, such as\nlearning disabilities, may appear later in childhood or even in adulthood.\nBabies born to women who smoked during pregnancy are at risk of other problems,\nincluding:\nIdeally, you should stop smoking before pregnancy. But stopping smoking during\npregnancy is better than not stopping at all. If you are smoking when you find out you\nare pregnant, you should stop. See the Resources section for how to get help with\nquitting.\nYes. Secondhand smoke is other people\u2019s smoke that you inhale. Breathing secondhand\nsmoke during pregnancy increases the risk of having a low-birth-weight baby. Also,\nbabies who are exposed to secondhand smoke have an increased risk of SIDS. They are\nmore likely to have asthma attacks and ear infections. Take steps to avoid secondhand\nsmoke at home and work.\nE-cigarettes are powered by a battery. They contain nicotine, plus flavoring and a\npropellant that may not be safe for you or your fetus.

The products used are called\nsmokeless tobacco. Smokeless tobacco also contains nicotine that can be passed to a\nfetus during pregnancy. These products also should be avoided.\nAlcohol can interfere with the normal growth of a fetus and cause birth defects. When a\nwoman drinks during pregnancy, her fetus can develop lifelong problems. It is safest not\nto drink at all while you are pregnant.\nFetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)  is the most severe disorder that can be caused by\ndrinking during pregnancy. FAS can cause:\nFAS is most likely to occur in infants whose mothers drink heavily throughout\npregnancy. But alcohol-related problems also can occur with lesser amounts of alcohol\nuse.\nIf it is hard for you to stop drinking, help is available (see the Resources section). Talk\nwith your obstetrician-gynecologist (ob-gyn)  or other obstetric care provider  about\nyour drinking habits. If you are dependent on alcohol, you may need specialized\ncounseling and medical care.\nMarijuana used during pregnancy is associated with attention and behavioral problems\nin children.

For these reasons, you should not use marijuana in any form during\npregnancy.\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that\npregnant women and those planning to get pregnant stop using medical marijuana. You\nand your ob-gyn or other obstetric care provider can discuss other treatments that will\nbe safer for your fetus.\nDrug use can mean using illegal drugs, such as heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamines\n(\u201cmeth\u201d). It also can mean using prescription medication in a way your doctor did not\norder, such as taking pain medication for the \u201chigh\u201d even when you no longer have pain.\nYour ob-gyn or other obstetric care provider may ask about your use of drugs\nthroughout your pregnancy.\nThe early stage of pregnancy is the time when main body parts of the fetus form. Using\nillegal drugs or misusing prescription medication early in pregnancy can cause birth\ndefects and miscarriage .\nDuring the later weeks of pregnancy, illegal drug use can interfere with the growth of the\nfetus and cause preterm birth and fetal death. Babies born to women who used illegal\ndrugs during pregnancy may need specialized care after birth. These babies have an\nincreased risk of long-term medical and behavioral problems.\nOpioids  are a type of medication that relieves pain. They also release chemicals in the\nbrain that have a calming effect. Doctors may prescribe opioids for people who have\nI have a prescription for medical marijuana \u2014 is it safe to use it during\npregnancy?\nWhat should I know about drug use during pregnancy?\nHow do drugs affect the fetus early in pregnancy?\nHow do drugs affect the fetus later in pregnancy?\nWhat are opioids?\n\nhad surgery, dental work, or an injury. Prescribed opioids include oxycodone,\nhydromorphone, hydrocodone, fentanyl, and codeine.\nWhen taken under a doctor\u2019s care, opioids are safe for both you and your fetus. If you\nare prescribed an opioid before or during pregnancy, you and your ob-gyn or other\nobstetric care provider should discuss the risks and benefits of this treatment. It is\nimportant to take the medication only as prescribed.\nMost people who use a prescription opioid have no trouble stopping their use, but some\npeople develop an addiction. This is called opioid use disorder . People with this\ndisorder may look for other ways to get the drug when their prescription runs out. They\nmay go from doctor to doctor to have new prescriptions written for them, or they may\nuse illegal opioids.\nMisusing opioids during pregnancy can increase the risk of serious complications ,\nincluding:\nThe best treatment for opioid use disorder during pregnancy is opioid replacement\nmedication, behavioral therapy, and counseling. The medications that are given are long-\nacting opioids. This means that they stay active in the body for a long time.

Treatment with either methadone or buprenorphine makes it more likely that the\nfetus will grow normally and not be born too early. Based on many years of research,\nneither medicine has been found to cause birth defects.\nSome babies born to women taking opioids, including methadone or buprenorphine\ntaken for treatment of opioid use disorder, can have temporary withdrawal symptoms.\nThis is called neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) . Symptoms of NAS can include\nshaking and tremors, poor feeding or sucking, crying, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, and sleep\nproblems.\nNot all babies will go through withdrawal. For those that do, some things can be done to\nmake babies with NAS feel better, including swaddling, breastfeeding, and skin-to-skin\ncontact. Some babies also may be given medication.

But\ntravel may not be recommended if you have pregnancy complications . If you are\nplanning a trip, talk with your obstetrician\u2013gynecologist (ob-gyn) . And no matter how\nyou choose to travel, think ahead about your comfort and safety.\nThe best time to travel is mid-pregnancy (14 to 28 weeks). During these weeks, your\nenergy has returned, morning sickness is improved or gone, and you are still able to get\naround easily. After 28 weeks, it may be harder to move around or sit for a long time.\nPreparing for a Trip\nYes, talk about your travel plans with your ob-gyn. You can discuss whether it is safe for\nyou to travel. Travel is not recommended if you have certain complications, including\nFAQs\nIs travel safe during pregnancy?\nWhen is the best time to travel during pregnancy?\nShould I talk with my ob-gyn before a trip?\npreeclampsia\n\u2022\nprelabor rupture of membranes (PROM)\n\u2022\n\nYes, you should have a prenatal check-up before you leave. At this visit, your ob-gyn can\nconfirm your due date. You may also talk about whether you are up-to-date on\nvaccinations and symptoms to watch for while traveling.\nIf something goes wrong while you are away, your caregivers will need to know how far\nalong you are and any other important information about your pregnancy. If you\u2019ll be\ngoing far from home, take a copy of your health record with you.\nYour ob-gyn may want to double-check that your vaccines are up to date, even if you\nreviewed them at an earlier prenatal visit. Also, you may need more vaccines depending\non where you are going.\nSome symptoms could signal a health problem. Go to a hospital or call emergency\nmedical services right away if you have any of the following:\npreterm  labor\n\u2022\nShould I have a check-up before a trip?\nWhy is it important to know my due date before traveling?\nWhy would my ob-gyn check my vaccinations before travel?\nWhat symptoms should I watch for while traveling?\nVaginal bleeding\n\u2022\nPelvic or abdominal pain or contractions\n\u2022\nRupture of the membranes (your \u201cwater breaks\u201d)\n\u2022\nSigns and symptoms of preeclampsia (headache that will not go away, seeing spots\nor other changes in eyesight, swelling of the face or hands)\n\u2022\nSevere vomiting or diarrhea\n\u2022\nSigns of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  (read Preventing Deep Vein Thrombosis)\n\u2022\nWhat should I know about deep vein thrombosis and preventing blood clots?\n\nDVT is a condition in which a blood clot forms in the veins, usually in the leg. DVT can\nlead to a dangerous condition called pulmonary embolism. This is when a blood clot\ntravels to the lungs. Research shows that any type of travel lasting 4 hours or more\u2014\nwhether by car, train, bus, or plane\u2014doubles the risk of DVT. Being pregnant is an extra\nrisk factor for DVT.\nIf you are planning a long trip, take the following steps to reduce your risk of DVT:\nSpecial stockings that compress the legs, either below the knee or full length, can be\nworn to help prevent blood clots from forming. Talk with your ob-gyn before you try\nthese stockings. Some people should not wear them (for example, those with diabetes\nmellitus  and other circulation problems). Also, compression stockings can increase the\nrisk of DVT if they are too tight or worn incorrectly.\nVisit your ob-gyn at least 4 to 6 weeks before a trip outside the United States. At this\nvisit you can go over your travel plans, get advice about specific health issues, and\ndiscuss vaccines that are recommended for the area you will be visiting.\nThis also gives you time to call your health insurance. Ask if you are covered outside the\nUnited States. If not, you may be able to buy travel health insurance.\nCarry a copy of your health record with you outside the country. Also, before leaving\nhome, locate the nearest hospital or medical clinic in the place you are visiting.\nTraveling by Car, Plane, or Ship\nWhen taking a car trip, keep in mind the shortest route is often the best. Make each\nday\u2019s drive as brief as possible. Also follow these tips:\nDrink lots of fluids without caffeine.\n\u2022\nWear loose-fitting clothing.\n\u2022\nWalk and stretch at regular intervals.\n\u2022\nHow should I prepare for international travel?\nWhat are some ways to make car trips safer?\n\nRead Car Safety for Pregnant Women, Babies, and Children\u00a0for more advice.\nDuring a healthy pregnancy, occasional air travel is almost always safe. Most airlines\nallow you to fly domestically until about 36 weeks of pregnancy. Your ob-gyn can\nprovide proof of your due date if you need it.\nIf you are planning an international flight, the cut-off for traveling may be earlier. Check\nwith your airline.\nAvoid flying if you have a medical or pregnancy condition that may be made worse by\nflying or could require emergency medical care. Keep in mind that most common\npregnancy emergencies usually happen in the first and third trimesters .\nYes. Lower air pressure during a flight may slightly reduce the amount of oxygen  in your\nblood, but your body will adjust. Radiation  exposure increases at higher altitudes, but\nthe level of exposure isn\u2019t a concern for pregnant women. If you are a frequent flier, talk\nwith your ob-gyn about how much flying is safe for you.\nWear your seat belt at all times. The belt should sit low on your hip bones, below your\nbelly.\n\u2022\nPlan to make frequent stops. Use these stops to move around and stretch your legs.\n\u2022\nWear comfortable shoes and clothing that is not too tight.\n\u2022\nWear a few layers of light clothing that can easily be added or removed.\n\u2022\nEat regular meals to boost your energy.\n\u2022\nDrink extra fluids. Take water with you. You may need to pee more often\u2014don\u2019t hold it\ntoo long.\n\u2022\nIs air travel safe during pregnancy?\nWhen should I not fly?\nAre plane cabins safe for pregnant women?\nHow can I make plane travel more comfortable?\nBook an aisle seat if you can. This makes it easier to get up and stretch your legs\nduring a long flight.\n\u2022\n\nOne of the most common health problems for people taking a cruise is seasickness\n(also called motion sickness). Seasickness can cause nausea, dizziness, weakness,\nheadache, and vomiting.\nIf you have never taken a cruise, planning your first one while you are pregnant may not\nbe a good idea. But if seasickness is usually not a problem for you, traveling by sea\nduring pregnancy may not upset your stomach.\nYou may have heard about noroviruses, which affect the digestive system. Noroviruses\nare very contagious and can spread quickly on ships.\nSymptoms include cramping, diarrhea, and vomiting. You can get infected by eating\nfood, drinking liquids, or touching surfaces that are contaminated with the virus. If you\nhave symptoms of norovirus while on a cruise, seek medical care right away.\nAvoid gas-producing carbonated drinks before or during your flight. Gas expands at\nhigh altitude and can cause discomfort. Drink water instead.\n\u2022\nWear your seat belt at all times. Turbulence can happen without warning during air\ntravel. The belt should sit low on your hip bones, below your belly.\n\u2022\nMove your feet, toes, and legs often. Get up and walk around a few times during your\nflight.\n\u2022\nWhat should I know about traveling by ship?\nHow should I plan to stay healthy on a cruise?\nPlan to wash your hands often with soap and water. Pack hand sanitizer that\ncontains at least 60 percent alcohol for those times when you won\u2019t be near a sink.\n\u2022\nBefore you leave, ask your ob-gyn about which medications are safe for you to take\nto calm seasickness, if needed.\n\u2022\nMake sure a doctor or nurse is on the ship and that your scheduled stops are places\nwith modern medical facilities in case you need medical attention.\n\u2022\nI've heard about stomach viruses on cruises. What should I know?\n\nBefore you book a cruise, you can check whether your ship has passed a health and\nsafety inspection conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nThe CDC inspects cruise ships to prevent widespread virus outbreaks. You can read\nthese reports on the CDC\u2019s Vessel Sanitation Program website\n(www.cdc.gov/nceh/vsp).\nPreventing Infections\nThe CDC has health notices and travel recommendations by country on its Travelers\u2019\nHealth website (wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel).\nYou can take steps to protect yourself and others from COVID-19 while you travel.

This\nmakes vaccination an important part of preventing infections during pregnancy. If you\nare pregnant or thinking about getting pregnant, you need certain vaccines. At different\npoints during their lives, babies, children, teens, adults, and seniors all need certain\nvaccines, too.\n[Are you current on your vaccines? These are the ones you should get as an adult.]\nMost vaccines are made with inactivated (killed) versions of a pathogen (a virus or\nbacteria that causes disease). Some vaccines are made with parts of the pathogen or\nwith a killed toxin made by the pathogen. None of these things can cause the disease\nitself when given as a vaccine. Most vaccines also contain some other ingredients,\nincluding\nFAQs\nWhy are vaccines important?\nHow are vaccines made?\nwater or other fluids\n\u2022\npreservatives and stabilizers\n\u2022\nchemicals added to inactivate the virus or bacteria\n\u2022\nsubstances that help create a stronger immune response to the vaccine\n\u2022\nsmall amounts of the material that was used to grow the virus or bacteria\n\u2022\n\nThe amounts of these ingredients are very small. All of them are tested extensively to\nmake sure they are safe. You can learn more about these ingredients from the Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nVaccines are subject to strict safety standards. In the United States, vaccines are\napproved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) only after thorough research.\nTesting starts with animals and small groups of human volunteers. Later, vaccines are\ntested in large clinical trials with thousands of volunteers. If a clinical trial shows that a\nvaccine is safe and effective, there are a few other safety reviews. Then vaccine experts\nmeet to review the testing results.\nOnce a vaccine is licensed by the FDA, a committee called the Advisory Committee on\nImmunization Practices (ACIP) at the CDC recommends how best to use it to control\ndisease. This recommendation goes to the CDC director, who reviews and approves the\nrecommendation.\nVaccines and Pregnancy\nVaccines cause the body to create antibodies . Antibodies are proteins that can identify\nbacteria and viruses and stop them from entering cells  and making a person sick. After\nyou get a vaccine during pregnancy and your body creates antibodies, some of those\nantibodies pass to the fetus. This means the baby will have the antibodies to protect\nagainst disease after birth.\nAntibodies are a safe, normal reaction to a vaccine. They protect your baby during the\nfirst few months of life until your baby can be vaccinated.\nIt is safe to get vaccines for the flu, whooping cough, COVID-19, respiratory syncytial\nvirus (RSV), hepatitis , pneumonia , and certain types of meningitis  during pregnancy.\nHow are vaccines approved?\nHow does getting vaccinated during pregnancy protect my baby?\nWhich vaccines may be given during pregnancy?\nWhich vaccines should be given in every pregnancy?\n\nTwo vaccines are recommended during each pregnancy:\nCertain vaccines should not be given during pregnancy because they contain live,\nattenuated viruses. \u201cAttenuated\u201d means that the virus has been weakened so that it\ncannot cause disease in a healthy person. The vaccines that women should not get\nduring pregnancy include\nTdap vaccine\u2014This vaccine protects against whooping cough. Tdap vaccines\u00a0are\nrecommended between 27 and 36 weeks of pregnancy.\n\u2022\nFlu vaccine\u2014The flu is a serious illness that can be much more severe during\npregnancy. You should get a flu vaccine\u00a0if you are pregnant during flu season\n(October through May). It is best to get the flu vaccine early in the flu season, as soon\nas the vaccine is available.\n\u2022\nWhen are other vaccines recommended during pregnancy?\nRSV vaccine\u2014The Pfizer RSV vaccine\u00a0is recommended if you are 32 to 36 weeks\npregnant from September to January. RSV is a seasonal virus that can be dangerous\nfor babies and young children.\n\u2022\nCOVID-19 vaccine\u2014If you are pregnant and not up to date on your COVID-19\nvaccines, you should get the currently recommended vaccine.\n\u2022\nHepatitis, pneumonia, and certain meningitis vaccines\u2014These may be\nrecommended based on your risk of getting these diseases. Talk with your\nobstetrician\u2013gynecologist (ob-gyn)  about the vaccines that you have had in the\npast. Your ob-gyn may recommend these vaccines based on your medical history\nand occupation.\n\u2022\nAre there vaccines that should not be given during pregnancy?\nlive, attenuated flu vaccine given as a nasal spray (but the flu shot is safe)\n\u2022\nmeasles\u2013mumps\u2013rubella (MMR) vaccine\n\u2022\nchickenpox  vaccine\n\u2022\n\nAlso, the vaccine for human papillomavirus (HPV)  is not a live, attenuated vaccine, but\nit still should not be given during pregnancy.\nVaccine Safety\nYes, vaccines are safe for both of you. In fact, vaccination is one of the most important\nthings that you can do to protect your health and your baby\u2019s health. Keep in mind that\nvaccines have been safely given to millions of pregnant women for more than 50 years.\nThere is a tiny amount of mercury (also called thimerosal) in a small number of\nvaccines. It is safe and not harmful during pregnancy. But it is no longer used in most\nnew vaccines due to new technology.\nThimerosal is safe because it uses a type of mercury called ethylmercury. This is\ndifferent than the type of mercury found in fish. Ethylmercury is a nonpoisonous salt,\nand it naturally leaves the body after a vaccine.\nThimerosal is used mainly in vaccines that come in multidose vials. This means the vial\nhas enough vaccine for more than one person. Vials with more than one dose need to\nbe kept pure. Thimerosal helps prevent germs from growing in a vial that has multiple\ndoses. But most new vaccines come in single-dose vials, which is why thimerosal is not\nused much anymore.\nFind more information about thimerosal and vaccine safety and all vaccine ingredients\nfrom the CDC.\nSome people have no side effects from getting a vaccine. Other people have mild side\neffects, such as a sore arm or a low fever, that go away within a day or two. Severe side\neffects and reactions are rare. The CDC monitors reactions for all vaccines given in the\nUnited States.\nAre vaccines safe for me and my baby?\nIs there mercury in vaccines?\nDo vaccines have side effects?\n\nWhen you get a vaccine, you should get an information sheet that lists the possible side\neffects associated with that vaccine. If you have ever had a reaction to a vaccine, or if\nyou have concerns about side effects, talk with your ob-gyn.\nCOVID-19 Vaccines\nCurrently there are two types of COVID-19 vaccines available in the United States: mRNA\n(Moderna and Pfizer) and protein subunit (Novavax).\nTo understand how vaccines work, it helps to understand the COVID-19 virus. The\nsurface of COVID-19 cells contains a \u201cspike protein.\u201d This protein attaches to and infects\nhealthy cells in the body.\nThe COVID-19 vaccines work by teaching your body to fight the spike protein so it\ncannot bind to healthy cells. There is no live or inactive (killed) virus in the mRNA and\nprotein subunit vaccines. Learn more about these types of vaccines and how they work\nfrom the CDC.\nThese vaccines cannot give you COVID-19. The vaccines do not affect your genes or\nDNA. There is no evidence that the COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility or have an\nimpact on pregnancy.\nYes, COVID-19 vaccines are safe during pregnancy. Scientists have compared the\npregnancies of women who have received COVID-19 vaccines and women who have\nnot. The reports show that these women have had similar pregnancy outcomes. Data do\nnot show any safety concerns.
